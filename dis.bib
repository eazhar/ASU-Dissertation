	abstract = {ZnO nanowire (NW) visible-blind UV photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G ∼ 108 have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10-9 to 102 s, revealing the coexistence of fast (τ ∼ 20 ns) and slow (τ ∼ 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t {\textless} 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than ∼10 GHz. The high gain and low power consumption of NW photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.},

These phenomena are caused by surface effects of the ZnO nanobridge and strain-induced polarization effects, leading to band structure change.

	abstract = {Strain sensors based on individual ZnO piezoelectric fine-wires (PFWs; nanowires, microwires) have been fabricated by a simple, reliable, and cost-effective technique. The electromechanical sensor device consists of a single electrically connected PFW that is placed on the outer surface of a flexible polystyrene (PS) substrate and bonded at its two ends. The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I−V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain. The change in SBH is suggested owing to the strain induced band structure change and piezoelectric effect. The experimental data can be well-described by the thermionic emission−diffusion model. A gauge factor of as high as 1250 has been demonstrated, which is 25\% higher than the best gauge factor demonstrated for carbon nanotubes. The strain sensor developed here has applications in strain and stress measurements in cell biology, biomedical sciences, MEMS devices, structure monitoring, and more.},

	url = {http://doi.org/10.1063/1.1992666},
	abstract = {The semiconductor ZnO has gained substantial interest in the research community in part because of its large exciton binding energy (60 meV) which could lead to lasing action based on exciton recombination even above room temperature. Even though research focusing on ZnO goes back many decades, the renewed interest is fueled by availability of high-quality substrates and reports of p-type conduction and ferromagnetic behavior when doped with transitions metals, both of which remain controversial. It is this renewed interest in ZnO which forms the basis of this review. As mentioned already, ZnO is not new to the semiconductor field, with studies of its lattice parameter dating back to 1935 by Bunn [Proc. Phys. Soc. London 47, 836 (1935)], studies of its vibrational properties with Raman scattering in 1966 by Damen et al. [Phys. Rev. 142, 570 (1966)], detailed optical studies in 1954 by Mollwo [Z. Angew. Phys. 6, 257 (1954)], and its growth by chemical-vapor transport in 1970 by Galli and Coker [Appl. Phys. Lett. 16, 439 (1970)]. In terms of devices, Au Schottky barriers in 1965 by Mead [Phys. Lett. 18, 218 (1965)], demonstration of light-emitting diodes (1967) by Drapak [Semiconductors 2, 624 (1968)], in which Cu2O was used as the p-type material, metal-insulator-semiconductor structures (1974) by Minami et al. [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 13, 1475 (1974)], ZnO/ZnSe n-p junctions (1975) by Tsurkan et al. [Semiconductors 6, 1183 (1975)], and Al/Au Ohmic contacts by Brillson [J. Vac. Sci. Technol. 15, 1378 (1978)] were attained. The main obstacle to the development of ZnO has been the lack of reproducible and low-resistivity p-type ZnO, as recently discussed by Look and Claflin [Phys. Status Solidi B 241, 624 (2004)]. While ZnO already has many industrial applications owing to its piezoelectric properties and band gap in the near ultraviolet, its applications to optoelectronic devices has not yet materialized due chiefly to the lack of p-type epitaxial layers. Very high quality what used to be called whiskers and platelets, the nomenclature for which gave way to nanostructures of late, have been prepared early on and used to deduce much of the principal properties of this material, particularly in terms of optical processes. The suggestion of attainment of p-type conductivity in the last few years has rekindled the long-time, albeit dormant, fervor of exploiting this material for optoelectronic applications. The attraction can simply be attributed to the large exciton binding energy of 60 meV of ZnO potentially paving the way for efficient room-temperature exciton-based emitters, and sharp transitions facilitating very low threshold semiconductor lasers. The field is also fueled by theoretical predictions and perhaps experimental confirmation of ferromagnetism at room temperature for potential spintronics applications. This review gives an in-depth discussion of the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of ZnO in addition to the technological issues such as growth, defects, p-type doping, band-gap engineering, devices, and nanostructures.},

The average growth rate of our nanowires is determined to be as high as 100 nm min −1 , depending on the microwave power. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a defect-free single-crystalline lattice of the nanowires. A detailed analysis of the growth characteristics of ZnO nanowires as functions of growth time and microwave power is reported.

We use the first-principles pseudopotential method to determine the electronic structure, atomic geometry, and formation energy of native point defects in ZnO. Interstitials, vacancies, and antisites in their relevant charge states are considered and the effects of dopants are also discussed. The results show that both the Zn and O vacancies are the relevant defects in ZnO.

	abstract = {Uniformly distributed ZnO nanorods have been grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using a two-step process. By controlling the oxygen content in the gas mixture during the nucleation and growth steps, no catalyst is required for the formation of ZnO nanorods. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies show that ZnO nanorods are single crystals and that they grow along the c axis of the crystal plane. Alignment of these nanorods with respect to the substrates depends on the lattice mismatch between ZnO and the substrate, the surface electric field, and the amount of defects in the starting nuclei. Room-temperature photoluminescence measurements of these ZnO nanorods have shown ultraviolet peaks at 380 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 106 meV, which are comparable to those found in high-quality ZnO films. Photoluminescence measurements of annealed ZnO nanorods in hydrogen and oxygen atmospheres indicate that the origins of green emission are oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, while oxygen interstitials are responsible for the orange-red emission. A mechanism for the nanorod growth is proposed. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

In this work, the dynamic mechanical relaxation behavior of compression-molded PTT films has been investigated. The added flexibility of the PTT was found to lower the temperature of the beta- and alpha-transitions relative to the PET and PEN. The results suggest that the beta-transition is at least two relaxations for PET and PTT due to the increase in the breadth of the relaxation. The results seem to support the hypothesized mechanism of others, in that the beta-transition involves the relaxation of the carbonyl entity and the aromatic C1-C4 ring flips for PTT and PET, and the relaxation of the carbonyl for PEN. The beta*- and alpha-transitions for all three polymers seem to be cooperative in nature. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale assembly of highly ordered, dense, and regular arrays of NWs with high uniformity and reproducibility through a simple contact printing process. The assembled NW pitch is shown to be readily modulated through the surface chemical treatment of the receiver substrate, with the highest density approaching ∼8 NW/μm, ∼95\% directional alignment, and wafer-scale uniformity. Such fine control in the assembly is attained by applying a lubricant during the contact printing process which significantly minimizes the NW−NW mechanical interactions, therefore enabling well-controlled transfer of nanowires through surface chemical binding interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our printing approach enables large-scale integration of NW arrays for various device structures on both rigid silicon and flexible plastic substrates, with a controlled semiconductor channel width ranging from a single NW (∼10 nm) up to ∼250 μm, consisting of a parallel array of over 1250 NWs and delivering over 1 mA of ON current.},

The carrier concentration of the ITO films increased with heat treatment in the 5\% H2/Ar ambient. However, the carrier concentration of the ITO films decreased with heat treatment in oxygen and air atmospheres, respectively. Different annealing ambients affect the electrical properties of ITO/PEN samples by changing the oxygen vacancy in the ITO layer. Electrical mobilities were found to be affected by the carrier concentration. These experimental mobility values were in good agreement with those obtained from a theoretical ionized impurity scattering mechanism model.

All-transparent junctional devices have begun a new generation in the optoelectronics technology called "Invisible Electronics". Non-stoichiometric and doped versions of various new types of p-type transparent conducting oxides (p-TCO) with improved optical and electrical properties have been synthesized in the last few years in this direction. A wide range of deposition techniques has been adopted to prepare the films. In this review we have tried to discuss the origin of p-type conductivity in these transparent oxides. Also an up-to-date and comprehensive description of different p-type transparent conducting oxide thin films is presented. The growth techniques of these films along with the relative deposition parameters are reviewed in detail. Electrical and optical properties of the films and fabrication of all-transparent diodes are discussed which are important in the development of "Transparent Electronics". Also, recently, the research on nanostructured materials generates great interest in the scientific community and offers tremendous opportunities in the field of physics, chemistry, materials science and related interdisciplinary areas because of new properties exhibited by them and challenging problems thrown up for providing theoretical concepts in physics associated with it. Here, we have also discussed in brief, the formation of different nanocrystalline p-TCO films, which may open up an extremely important and interesting field of research for the fabrication of all-transparent nanoactive devices and give a new dimension in the field of "Transparent Electronics".

With an incident wavelength of 370 nm and 1 V applied bias, it was found that the responsivity for the 10 x 10 photodiode was 0.135 A/W, which corresponds to a quantum efficiency of 44.9\%. Furthermore, it was found that noise equivalent power and corresponding detectivity D* of the 10 x 10 photodiodes were 3.17 x 10(-13) W and 2.23 x 10(12) cm Hz(0.5) W-1, respectively.

The photoconductive type of Mg 0.4 Zn 0.6 O metal–semiconductor–metal ultraviolet detector was prepared. The ratio of the ultraviolet to visible was more than four orders of magnitude; the 10\%–90\% rise and fall times were 16 ns and 250 ns, respectively. Furthermore, the dark current was below 40 nA under 3 V bias and the gain was observed which caused the high responsivity ( 1.3 A W −1 ) at 320 nm, and the corresponding detectivity D * was 1.37 × 10 11 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 . A high-speed response was attributed to the high quality of the Mg 0.4 Zn 0.6 O thin film, which was found to dramatically enhance the UV detection properties of the device.

Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 {nS} and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm2/V·s with peak values of 2000 {nS} and 1350 cm2/V·s, respectively.

	abstract = {Solar cells are attractive candidates for clean and renewable power; with miniaturization, they might also serve as integrated power sources for nanoelectronic systems. The use of nanostructures or nanostructured materials represents a general approach to reduce both cost and size and to improve efficiency in photovoltaics. Nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires have been used to improve charge collection efficiency in polymer-blend and dye-sensitized solar cells, to demonstrate carrier multiplication, and to enable low-temperature processing of photovoltaic devices. Moreover, recent theoretical studies have indicated that coaxial nanowire structures could improve carrier collection and overall efficiency with respect to single-crystal bulk semiconductors of the same materials. However, solar cells based on hybrid nanoarchitectures suffer from relatively low efficiencies and poor stabilities. In addition, previous studies have not yet addressed their use as photovoltaic power elements in nanoelectronics. Here we report the realization of p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) coaxial silicon nanowire solar cells. Under one solar equivalent (1-sun) illumination, the p-i-n silicon nanowire elements yield a maximum power output of up to 200 {pW} per nanowire device and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of up to 3.4 per cent, with stable and improved efficiencies achievable at high-flux illuminations. Furthermore, we show that individual and interconnected silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements can serve as robust power sources to drive functional nanoelectronic sensors and logic gates. These coaxial silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements provide a new nanoscale test bed for studies of photoinduced energy/charge transport and artificial photosynthesis, and might find general usage as elements for powering ultralow-power electronics and diverse nanosystems.},

	abstract = {{ZnO} nanowire ({NW}) visible-blind {UV} photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G ? 108 have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10-9 to 102 s, revealing the coexistence of fast (τ ? 20 ns) and slow (τ ? 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the {NW} surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t {\textless} 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of {ZnO} {NW} photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products ({GB}) higher than ?10 {GHz}. The high gain and low power consumption of {NW} photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.},

The Boltzmann transport equation is solved for this formulation using a variational procedure and assuming generalized Fermi-Dirac statistics. The contributions of component scattering mechanisms to the total electron mobility are discussed as a function of temperature. Inherent mobility limits of about 1500 cm2V-1s-1 (300 K) and about 20 000 cm2V-1s-1 (77 K) are reported for the first time; these values occur at electron concentrations of about 2*1018cm-3 and below 1*1014cm3 respectively. Special attention is given to assessing the importance of compensation on the transport characteristics of {ZnTe}. Thus curves are presented which permit compensation ratios to be determined from experimental transport data. Available experimental data are discussed and shown to fall well within the bounds of the present theoretical model.},

The dependence of the electron mobility on the carrier concentration suggests that the dominant scattering mechanisms in the {ZnTe}:Al layers are ionized impurity scattering and polar optical phononscattering. The photoluminescence spectrum of moderately doped {ZnTe} layers shows strong Al–donor-related bound exciton lines: I 2 (2.378 {eV}) and donor–acceptor pair emission (zero phonon energy=2.324 {eV}) with a weak deep-level emission (2.19 {eV}). Highly Al-doped layers show an increase in the deep-level emission intensity and a decrease in carrier mobility, which are interpreted in terms of the increase in the carrier compensation.},

Single {ZnTe} nanowire based photodetectors on rigid silicon substrate exhibited high sensitivity and excellent stability to visible incident light with responstivity and quantum efficiency as high as 1.87 × 105 A/W and 4.36 × 107\% respectively and are stable in a wide temperature range (25-250 °C). The polarization-sensitivity of the {ZnTe} nanowires was studied for the first time. The results revealed a periodic oscillation with the continuous variation of polarization angles. Besides, flexible photodetectors were also fabricated with the features of excellent flexibility, stability and sensitivity to visible incident light.

X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterization indicate that the as-grown twin nanowire has a zinc-blende crystal structure with an integrated growth direction of [11-1]. The twin plane is (11-1) and the angle between the mirror symmetrical planes is 141°. The formation of twins is attributed to the surface tension from the eutectic liquid droplet. Field-effect transistors based on single {ZnTe} twin nanowire are constructed, the corresponding electrical measurements demonstrate that the twin nanowires have a p-type conductivity with a mobility (μ h ) of 0.11 cm2 V−1 S−1, and a carrier concentration (n h ) of 1.1×1017 cm−3. Significantly, the negative differential resistance with a peak-to-valley current ratio of about 1.3 is observed in p-type twin {ZnTe} nanowire field-effect transistors at room temperature. As the periodic barriers produced in the periodic twin interfaces can form multi-barrier and multi-well along one-dimensional direction. The multibarrier can be modulated under external electrical field. When the resonant condition is met, the space charge will be enhanced with the inherent feedback mechanism, and the resonant tunneling will occur.},

Ultralong ZnTe nanobelts were synthesized to reach the subcentimeter length scale. Two types of nanobelts were identified according to whether tapering was present and discerned on the basis of crystallinity and polarity of the structure. We conclude that tapered sheetlike nanobelts have Te-terminated lateral facets that induced lateral growth, whereas untapered nanobelts have facets that are nonpolar and nonreactive. Axial and transversal twins were also observed, where the polarity was conserved across twinning boundaries.},

	abstract = {In this study the electric and optical spectroscopy techniques have been applied to investigate ZnTe (p-type)–Ti/Au Schottky diodes containing a layer of CdTe self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs). The reference sample was the ZnTe–Ti/Au diode without dots. Both samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy technique. Raman measurements confirmed the presence of the CdTe layer while the photoluminescence proved that CdTe quantum dots were formed in the investigated structure. The PL spectra reveal the CdTe QD electron-hole recombination energy equal to 2.1 eV at 10 K. Based on the temperature PL measurements the activation energy of PL quenching has been determined to be equal to 22 meV. Further confirmation for the QD formation has been obtained from the C–V characteristics which exhibited a step related to the charge accumulation at the QD states. DLTS spectra for the sample with QDs yield three hole-related signals with apparent activation energies equal to EH1 = 0.16 eV, EH2 = 0.2 eV and EH3 = 0.4 eV. For the reference ZnTe–Ti/Au diode solely single signal was observed of signature close to the level H3 in the QD sample. Detailed characterization of the traps as well as the PL studies lead to the conclusion that the level H2 is related to the defects located close to the QDs created during the growth while the other traps are associated with defects present in the ZnTe bulk material.},

	abstract = {Sb-doped p-type ZnTe nanoribbons (NRs) and Ga-doped n-type CdSe NRs were synthesized via a co-thermal evaporation method in a horizontal tube furnace, respectively. Crossbar heterojunction diode (HD) devices were constructed from p-ZnTe:Sb NRs and n-CdSe NRs by a convenient route. The p-ZnTe/n-CdSe NR HD device exhibits a significant rectification characteristic with a rectification ratio up to 103 within ±5 V and a low turn-on voltage of 2.6 V. Photoresponse analysis reveals that such HD devices were highly sensitive to light illumination with excellent stability, reproducibility and fast response speeds of 37/118 μs at reverse bias voltage. It is expected that such HD devices will have great potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices in the future.},

	abstract = {Sb-doped ZnTe nanoribbons (NRs) with enhanced p-type conductivity were successfully synthesized by a simple thermal co-evaporation method. Nanodevices, including nano-field-effect transistors (FETs) and nano-photodetectors (nanoPDs), were constructed based on the ZnTe:Sb NRs and their structure dependent device performances were systemically investigated. It is found that the transport properties of the ZnTe nanostructures as well as the device structures play a critical role in determining the device performances. In contrast to the nano-metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (nanoMOSFETs) with back-gate structure, the top-gate nano-metal-insulator-semiconductor FETs (nanoMISFETs) show much enhanced performances in all aspects. On the other hand, owing to the appropriate p-type doping, nano-photodetectors (nanoPDs) based on the ZnTe:Sb NRs exhibit excellent device performances, such as high responsivity and photoconductive gain, fast response speed, large detectivity and so on. Moreover, the response time could be effectively shortened by using nano-heterojunction photodetectors (nanoHPDs). It is expected that knowledge gained from this work could be readily extended to nanodevices based on other nanostructures.},

Measurements show that if the ZnTe:Cu layer thickness remains constant and contact temperature is varied, τ increases significantly above its as-deposited value when the contacting temperature is in a range that has been shown to yield high-performance devices ({\textasciitilde} 280° to {\textasciitilde} 320 °C).

	abstract = {By the use of the electron beam plasma technique, it has been found that the solid solutions of Ga1−x In x N can be synthesized over the entire composition region. From the optical measurements, the direct energy gap at 78 °K was determined to be 3.46 eV for GaN and 2.11 eV for InN. Also its composition dependence was found to deviate downward from linearity. From the infrared reflectivity measurement and the resultant K‐K dispersion analysis, the transverse optical frequencies for long‐wavelength phonons of GaN and InN were 563 and 478 cm−1, respectively. The optical phonons in this quasibinary system were concluded to exhibit a one‐mode–type behavior. The Brout sum rule was discussed for a large number of the diatomic crystals of A N B 8−N type and its relation with respect to the reduced mass was derived as Σ i ω2 i (k=0) =A μ−1.5. According to this relation, the longitudinal optical frequency of InN was deduced to be 694 cm−1. On the other hand, from the result of the annealing treatment for the solid‐solution alloys and the theoretical consideration, it was pointed out that this quasibinary system has a solid‐phase misibility gap in chemical equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The effects of indium segregation and hydrogen on the optical and structural properties of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells, grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition were investigated. Photoluminescence and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that two types of indium-rich regions can be formed in the InGaN well layers. Self-assembled quantum dot-like indium-rich regions were found in the well layer grown at a normal growth temperature. These regions behaved as luminescent centers, showing a maximum indium content at the center of indium-rich region. However, randomly-distributed indium-segregated regions, which formed near the upper interface of the InGaN well layers during the subsequent high-temperature annealing process led to the degradation of the optical properties by generating defects such as misfit dislocations. The use of hydrogen during the growth interruption was found to be very effective in suppressing the formation of i! ndium-segregated regions in the InGaN well layers. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

The prepared heterojunctions consist of a p‐s‐n structure with distributed trap centers at the boundary region. The heterodiodes show an emission band peaking at about 1.94–2.04 eV at room temperature. At 77 K, the spectra generally have four emission bands at 1.98, 2.32, 2.70, and 2.78 eV. The dominance of any one of these emission bands over the others depends upon the preparation conditions. The photoluminescence measurements of the heterojunctions show that the light generation of the heterodiode occurs at the ZnSe branch of the junction: The emission occurs through hole injection from the p‐type ZnTe into the n‐type ZnSe. The best value for the external quantum efficiency of the light emission in the heterodiodes measured by an integrating sphere method is about 4×10−3 photons per electron at 77 K. The relation between the luminescence and the electrical characteristics of the prepared heterodiodes is discussed with tentative band models.},

Such devices have been enabled by manipulation of excitons in organic and molecular semiconductors that allow for selective ultraviolet and near-infrared solar conversion. Here, the theoretical efficiency limits of transparent photovoltaics are determined as a function of transparency. Power-production from ultraviolet and near-infrared photons alone leads to a theoretical single-junction efficiency of 21\% in transparent structures, compared to 33\% for opaque-junctions.

Measurements of transmission spectra reveal that {ZnO}:Al films have an average transmission of over 83\% in visible wavelength range, slightly depending on Ar pressure. The roughness and morphology of films are very sensitive to change of Ar pressure and microstructure is in agreement with the trend given by Thornton’s structure zone model.

	abstract = {The {semiconductorZnO} has gained substantial interest in the research community in part because of its large exciton binding energy ( 60 {meV} ) which could lead to lasing action based on exciton recombination even above room temperature. Even though research focusing on {ZnO} goes back many decades, the renewed interest is fueled by availability of high-quality substrates and reports of p -type conduction and ferromagnetic behavior when doped with transitions metals, both of which remain controversial. It is this renewed interest in {ZnO} which forms the basis of this review. As mentioned already, {ZnO} is not new to the semiconductor field, with studies of its lattice parameter dating back to 1935 by Bunn [Proc. Phys. Soc. London47, 836 (1935)], studies of its vibrational properties with Raman scattering in 1966 by Damen et al. [Phys. Rev.142, 570 (1966)], detailed optical studies in 1954 by Mollwo [Z. Angew. Phys.6, 257 (1954)], and its growth by chemical-vapor transport in 1970 by Galli and Coker [Appl. Phys. Lett.16, 439 (1970)]. In terms of devices, Au Schottky barriers in 1965 by Mead [Phys. Lett.18, 218 (1965)], demonstration of light-emitting diodes (1967) by Drapak [Semiconductors2, 624 (1968)], in which Cu 2 O was used as the p -type material, metal-insulator-semiconductor structures (1974) by Minami et al. [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys.13, 1475 (1974)], Zn O ∕ Zn Se n - p junctions (1975) by Tsurkan et al. [Semiconductors6, 1183 (1975)], and Al ∕ Au Ohmic contacts by Brillson [J. Vac. Sci. Technol.15, 1378 (1978)] were attained. The main obstacle to the development of {ZnO} has been the lack of reproducible and low-resistivity p -type {ZnO}, as recently discussed by Look and Claflin [Phys. Status Solidi B241, 624 (2004)]. While {ZnO} already has many industrial applications owing to its piezoelectric properties and band gap in the near ultraviolet, its applications to optoelectronic devices has not yet materialized due chiefly to the lack of p -type epitaxial layers. Very high quality what used to be called whiskers and platelets, the nomenclature for which gave way to nanostructures of late, have been prepared early on and used to deduce much of the principal properties of this material, particularly in terms of optical processes. The suggestion of attainment of p -type conductivity in the last few years has rekindled the long-time, albeit dormant, fervor of exploiting this material for optoelectronic applications. The attraction can simply be attributed to the large exciton binding energy of 60 {meV} of {ZnO} potentially paving the way for efficient room-temperature exciton-based emitters, and sharp transitions facilitating very low threshold semiconductor lasers. The field is also fueled by theoretical predictions and perhaps experimental confirmation of ferromagnetism at room temperature for potential spintronics applications. This review gives an in-depth discussion of the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of {ZnO} in addition to the technological issues such as growth, defects, p -type doping, band-gap engineering, devices, and nanostructures.},

The deposition parameters of {ZnO}:Al films were optimized. The optimized {ZnO}:Al films showed a strong and sharp (0 0 2) X-ray diffraction peak. The 600–800 nm thick {ZnO}–Al films showed a high transparency above 85\% in the visible range and a sheet resistance low to 10 Ω/□. {CIGS} solar cells with 1.2 μm thick absorbers were fabricated using bi-layer {ZnO} films (low resistive and thick {ZnO}:Al/high resistive and transparent thin i-{ZnO}) as front contacts. The thin absorber layers were prepared by the low cost technique involving co-sputtering of Cu–Ga alloy and In targets and selenization with Se powders. Efficiencies of the order of 6–7\% were achieved for the manufactured thin {CIGS} solar cells without antireflective films. The results demonstrated that {RF} sputtered {ZnO}:Al films are suitable for application in low cost and thin {CIGS} solar cells as transparent conductive electrode layers.},

	abstract = {A visible-light-active {ZnO} photocatalyst system in the presence of manganese ions (Mn/{ZnO}) was prepared via a simple and rapid approach. {XRD}, {XPS}, Raman scattering and {UV}-Vis {DRS} confirmed the manganese exists in multivalent forms (Mn3+/Mn2+) in the {ZnO} lattice, furthermore, {ZnO} light absorption is extended to the visible region. The photocatalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated by measuring the photodegrading efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenol ({DCP}) under visible light irradiation. With an optimal molar ratio of 5\% in Mn/{ZnO} the highest rate photodegradation was achieved under the experimental conditions. We have characterized the separation and transfer behavior of the photogenerated charges in the visible region by means of surface photovoltage ({SPV}), surface photocurrent ({SPC}) and transient photovoltage ({TPV}) techniques. Based on the comprehensive investigation of the photovoltaic properties of Mn/{ZnO} photocatalyst, we illustrate the behavior of photogenerated charges have distinct effects on the photocatalytic activity. It is demonstrated that the incorporation of multivalent Mn in {ZnO} promoted the separation of photogenerated charges, inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers, and thus prolonged the charges lifetime to participate in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in highly efficient photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the formation of a strong electronic interaction between the multivalent Mn and {ZnO}.},

	abstract = {The principal goal in the field of ferromagnetic semiconductors for devices is the synthesis, characterization and utilization of semiconductors that exhibit substantial carrier spin polarization at and above room temperature. Such materials are of critical importance in the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics. The interaction leading to carrier spin polarization, exchange coupling between the dopant spins and the valence or conduction band, is known to be sufficiently weak in conventional semiconductors such as {GaAs}, Si and Ge, that magnetic ordering above cryogenic temperatures is extraordinarily difficult to achieve, as experience has shown. Since the provocative theoretical predictions of Curie points above ambient in p-Mn:{ZnO} and p-Mn:{GaN} [T. Dietl, H. Ohno, F. Matsukura, J. Cibert, D. Ferrand, Science 287 (2000) 1019], and the observation of room-temperature ferromagnetism in Co: {TiO}2 anatase [Y. Matsumoto, M. Murakami, T. Shono, T. Hasegawa, T. Fukumura, M. Kawasaki, P. Ahmet, T. Chikyow, S.-Y. Koshihara, H. Koinuma, Science 291 (2001) 854], there has been a flurry of work in oxides and nitrides doped with transition metals with unpaired d electrons. It has even been claimed that room-temperature ferromagnetism can be obtained in certain d0 transition metals oxides without a dopant. In this Report, the field of magnetically doped oxides and nitrides is critically reviewed and assessed from a materials science perspective. The focus is on films prepared not only by conventional vacuum deposition methods, but also by spin coating colloidal nanoparticles in air. It is shown that despite their apparent simplicity, dilute magnetic systems are deceptively complex. High dopant mobilities and the existence of multiple structural configurations that are nearly degenerate lead to a range of embedded magnetic nanostructures within the host lattice. The resulting macroscopic magnetic properties are diverse and critically dependent on growth and processing conditions.},

	abstract = {The local environment of Mn atoms in ({ZnO}30 Å/Mnt)n multilayers ({ML}) has been studied by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn K edge. A series of {ML} has been prepared by sputtering with approximately constant total amount of Mn (300 Å) while the Mn layer thickness (t) has been varied from 60 to 1 Å (modifying consequently the number of Mn–{ZnO} interfaces) in order to study the Mn–Zn–O system. Variation of the Mn layer thickness (t) has been directly associated with changes in the Mn oxidation states within the sample series. Absorption spectroscopy results for films with t≤15 Å indicate mostly {MnO}2 formation and no signal of Mn in the {ZnO} lattice is found. Conversely, films with t≥30 Å present two different Mn environments, that have been related to the coexistence of rocksalt and wurtzite phases, formed by Zn1−{xMnxO} mixed solid solutions. The magnetic behaviour of samples is correlated with structural properties. That correlation strongly points towards substitutional Mn in the wurtzite phase as the origin of the observed ferromagnetism above room temperature.},

	abstract = {Building integrated photovoltaics ({BIPVs}) are photovoltaic ({PV}) modules integrated into the building envelope and hence also replacing traditional parts of the building envelope, e.g. the roofing. In this context, the {BIPVs} integration with the building envelope limits the costs by serving dual purposes. {BIPVs} have a great advantage compared to non-integrated systems because there is neither need for allocation of land nor stand-alone {PV} systems. This study seeks to outline various commercially available approaches to {BIPVs} and thus provides a state-of-the-art review. In addition, possible future research opportunities are explored.

The various categories of {BIPVs} may be divided into photovoltaic foils, photovoltaic tiles, photovoltaic modules and solar cell glazings. Silicon materials are the most commonly used, and a distinction is made between wafer-based technologies and thin-film technologies. In addition, various non-silicon materials are available. The main options for building integration of {PV} cells are on sloped roofs, flat roofs and facades. The evaluation of the different {BIPV} products involves, among others, properties such as solar cell efficiency, open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum effect and fill factor.

It is expected that the {BIPV} systems will improve in the years to come, regarding both device and manufacturing efficiency. The future seems very promising in the {BIPV} industry, both concerning new technologies, different solutions and the variety of {BIPV} options.},

Today, photovoltaic modules for building integration are produced as a standard building product, fitting into standard façade and roof structures these elements created a whole new market: {BIPV}.

	abstract = {Silicon is used in photovoltaics ({PV}) as the starting material for monocrystalline and multicrystalline wafers as well as for thin film silicon modules. More than 90\% of the annual solar cell production is based on crystalline silicon wafers. Therefore, silicon is the most important material for {PV} today. The challenge which the {PV}-industry is currently facing is to decrease the manufacturing costs per Wp annually by 5\%. Since approximately 70\% of the costs for solar cells are caused by wafer costs, there are two main avenues to achieve the cost reduction. One is the development of cheap solar grade Si feedstock material, the other is the development of a cheap ingot manufacturing process for multicrystalline silicon wafers. Therefore, one aim of the {PV}-industry is to produce sufficiently pure solar grade silicon at low manufacturing costs. Three different routes for the production of solar grade Si are currently considered. Processes like decomposition of trichlorosilane by means of a fluidized bed reactor or decomposition and melting by means of a tube reactor are under development. Monosilane decomposition by means of a free space reactor is also in progress. Every process should be able to achieve the criteria for solar grade Si. Especially, the decomposition of monosilane by means of a free space reactor will be able to meet this challenge as will be explained in more detail. Within the last 10 years multicrystalline (mc) silicon ingots for {PV} with weights of 150, 240 and 300 kg have been developed and are produced today in the standard production process. The state of the art growth rate of these ingots is 0.5–1.5 cm/h. The two main targets of the {PV}-industry today are first to increase the ingot weight and second to accelerate the growth of multicrystalline silicon ingots. First, results of the preparation of very large ingots with an ingot weight of 400 kg or ingots grown with growth rates higher than 2 cm/h will be presented.},

Here, we describe modules that use large-scale arrays of silicon solar microcells created from bulk wafers and integrated in diverse spatial layouts on foreign substrates by transfer printing. The resulting devices can offer useful features, including high degrees of mechanical flexibility, user-definable transparency and ultrathin-form-factor microconcentrator designs. Detailed studies of the processes for creating and manipulating such microcells, together with theoretical and experimental investigations of the electrical, mechanical and optical characteristics of several types of module that incorporate them, illuminate the key aspects.},

Such strategies typically involve three major technological changes: energy savings on the demand side, efficiency improvements in the energy production, and replacement of fossil fuels by various sources of renewable energy. Consequently, large-scale renewable energy implementation plans must include strategies for integrating renewable sources in coherent energy systems influenced by energy savings and efficiency measures. Based on the case of Denmark, this paper discusses the problems and perspectives of converting present energy systems into a 100\% renewable energy system. The conclusion is that such development is possible. The necessary renewable energy sources are present, and if further technological improvements of the energy system are achieved the renewable energy system can be created. Especially technologies of converting the transportation sector and the introduction of flexible energy system technologies are crucial.},

	abstract = {With the exception of {HgSe} and {HgTe}, {II}–{VI} compounds are direct gap semiconductors with sharp optical absorption edge and large absorption coefficients at above bandgap wavelengths. Device quality polycrystalline films of {II}–{VI} compounds can be prepared from inexpensive raw materials by a number of low-cost methods. They are well-suited for thin film solar cells and provide an economically viable approach to the terrestrial utilization of solar energy. Thin film {II}–{VI} solar cells are usually of the heterojunction type consisting of a high bandgap window (or collector) and a lower bandgap absorber. The grain boundary effects in polycrystalline {II}–{VI} films are considerably less pronounced than those in {III}–V films and can be passivated, at least partially, by chemical treatment. The use of {CdS}, {ZnO}, {ZnSe} and Cd1 − {xZnxS} as the window and the use of {CdTe} and Cd1 − {xZnxTe} as the absorber are reviewed in this paper. The fabrication and characteristics of a number of the thin film solar cell structures are discussed with emphasis on the thin film {CdSCdTe} solar cell.},

The short-circuit current (Jsc) was found to improve upon the replacement of the {ZnO}:Al layer with {ZnO}:B layers. This improvement in Jsc is attributed to an increase in quantum efficiency due to the higher optical transmission of the {ZnO}:B layer in the near-infrared region.

	abstract = {{ZnO} has emerged as a promising candidate for optoelectronic and microelectronic applications, whose development requires greater understanding and control of their electronic contacts. The rapid pace of {ZnO} research over the past decade has yielded considerable new information on the nature of {ZnO} interfaces with metals. Work on {ZnO} contacts over the past decade has now been carried out on high quality material, nearly free from complicating factors such as impurities, morphological and native point defects. Based on the high quality bulk and thin film crystals now available, {ZnO} exhibits a range of systematic interface electronic structure that can be understood at the atomic scale. Here we provide a comprehensive review of Schottky barrier and ohmic contacts including work extending over the past half century. For Schottky barriers, these results span the nature of {ZnO} surface charge transfer, the roles of surface cleaning, crystal quality, chemical interactions, and defect formation. For ohmic contacts, these studies encompass the nature of metal-specific interactions, the role of annealing, multilayered contacts, alloyed contacts, metallization schemes for state-of-the-art contacts, and their application to n-type versus p-type {ZnO}. Both {ZnO} Schottky barriers and ohmic contacts show a wide range of phenomena and electronic behavior, which can all be directly tied to chemical and structural changes on an atomic scale.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the present status and prospects for further development of Al-doped {ZnO} ({AZO})/n-type metal oxide semiconductor/p-type Cu2O hybrid heterojunction ({HbH}) solar cells that feature a structure that is fabricated by inserting an n-oxide semiconductor thin film between an {AZO} transparent electrode and a Cu2O sheet. An improvement of photovoltaic properties was achieved by both stabilizing the surface of polycrystalline p-Cu2O sheets that had been prepared by thermal oxidization of Cu sheets and also developing low-temperature and low-damage deposition technology for applying thin films as an n-oxide semiconductor layer. It should be noted that the obtainable photovoltaic properties in {AZO}/oxide semiconductor/Cu2O {HbH} solar cells were found to be considerably more affected by the surface condition of the p-Cu2O layer, i.e., the interface at the heterojunction, than the diffusion potential resulting from the difference of work functions between the p-Cu2O and n-oxide semiconductor layers. To achieve a higher efficiency in {AZO}/n-oxide semiconductor/p-Cu2O {HbH} solar cells, it was necessary to improve the interface at the heterojunction as well as reduce the series resistance and increase the parallel resistance of the {HbH} solar cells. The effect of the inserted n-oxide semiconductor thin film on the obtainable photovoltaic properties was investigated in the Cu2O-based {HbH} solar cells by inserting various kinds of n-oxide semiconductor thin films prepared under various deposition conditions using a pulsed laser deposition ({PLD}) method. Although either a nondoped {ZnO} or Ga2O3 thin film deposited at room temperature by {PLD} is suitable as the n-oxide semiconductor layer, an amorphous Ga2O3 thin film with a high resistivity was found to be the most suitable oxide. The improvement of the p–n junction, as seen in the Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction, could be achieved by decreasing the defect levels at the interface, which decreases not only the recombination associated with defects at the interface between the Ga2O3 and Cu2O, but also the conduction band discontinuity. We have achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of 5.38\% in an {AZO}/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cell fabricated by depositing a Ga2O3 thin film on a Cu2O sheet with a resistivity on the order of 102 Ω cm.},

We compare structures consisting of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) polymer in contact with three different types of {ZnO} layer: a flat {ZnO} backing layer alone; vertically aligned {ZnO} nanorods on a {ZnO} backing layer; and {ZnO} nanoparticles on a {ZnO} backing layer. We use scanning electron microscopy, steady state and transient absorption spectroscopies, and photovoltaic device measurements to study the morphology, charge separation, recombination behavior and device performance of the three types of structures. We find that charge recombination in the structures containing vertically aligned {ZnO} nanorods is remarkably slow, with a half-life of several milliseconds, over 2 orders of magnitude slower than that for randomly oriented {ZnO} nanoparticles. A photovoltaic device based on the nanorod structure that has been treated with an amphiphilic dye before deposition of the P3HT polymer yields a power conversion efficiency over four times greater than that for a similar device based on the nanoparticle structure. The best {ZnO} nanorod:P3HT device yields a short circuit current density of 2 {mAcm}(-2) under {AM}1.5 illumination (100 {mW} cm(-2)) and a peak external quantum efficiency over 14\%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 0.20\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract {ZnO}-graphene quasi core-shell quantum dot ({QD}) structures in which the inner {ZnO} {QDs} are covered with graphene nanoshells have been synthesized via a simple solution process method. The outer graphene nanoshells were identified as a single graphene layer using high resolution transmission electron microscopy ({HR}-{TEM}). Zn-O-C (graphene) chemical bonds between the inner {ZnO} {QDs} and the oxygen-containing functional groups introduced into the graphene layer are believed to be important in the formation of the consolidated quasi core-shell {QD} structure. A multilayer structure organic ultraviolet ({UV}) photovoltaic ({PV}) device was fabricated using {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} as the absorption layer. A quenching behavior as large as 71\% near the {UV} emission peak for the {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} was observed in the photoluminescence. Density of state ({DOS}) calculations for the graphene using density functional theory ({DFT}) revealed that the static quenching can be attributed to a faster charge separation via the direct electron transfer from the conduction band ({CB}) of the {ZnO} {QDs} to the induced lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ({LUMO}) of the graphene nanoshell resulting from the Zn-O-C bonding. This charge separation mechanism was confirmed experimentally using time-correlated single photon counting ({TCSPC}) measurements. The calculated average lifetime of 0.13 ns and 0.165 ns of the 375 and 383 nm {UV} emissions, respectively, for the {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} were approximately 10 times faster than those of 1.86 ns and 1.83 nm for the reference {ZnO} {QDs}; this is indicative of the existence of an additional high efficiency relaxation channel. The observed saturation current density (J sc), open circuit voltage (V oc), fill factor ({FF}), and power conversion efficiency (η) were 196.4 μA/cm2, 0.99 V, 0.24, and 2.33\%, respectively. In this study, it was found that the {UV} power conversion efficiency of {ZnO} {QDs} could be significantly improved by invoking a fast photoinduced charge separation and the subsequent transport of carriers to the collecting electrodes through conjugation with highly conductive graphene nanoshell acceptors to the {ZnO} {QDs} donor.

This transition is accompanied by reduction of the “green” deep level cathodoluminescence emission, suppression of the hydrogen donor-bound exciton photoluminescence and a ∼ 0.75 {eV} increase in n -type band bending observed via x-ray photoemission. These results demonstrate that the contact type conversion involves more than one mechanism, specifically, removal of the adsorbate-induced accumulation layer plus lowered tunneling due to reduction of near-surface donor density and defect-assisted hopping transport.},

Temperature-dependent tunneling characteristics showed that the tunneling current was dominant for the Zn-polar face over the entire temperature range (100–300 K). For the O-polar face, the tunneling current was dominant mainly at low temperatures (100–200 K) and the {TE} component contributed strongly to the current transport above 200 K.},

Photocatalysts prepared with these techniques, which were characterized with transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}), infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}), photo-co-relation spectroscopy ({PCS}) and {UV}–vis-spectroscopy showed significant difference in the optical absorption of Mn-doped {ZnO}. Enhancement in optical absorption of Mn-doped {ZnO} indicates that it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. The photo-reduction activities of photocatalysts were evaluated using a basic aniline dye, methylene blue ({MB}) as organic contaminant irradiated only with visible light from tungsten bulb. It was found that manganese-doped {ZnO} ({ZnO}:Mn2+) bleaches {MB} much faster than undoped {ZnO} upon its exposure to the visible light.

	abstract = {{ZnO} nanowire ({NW}) visible-blind {UV} photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G ? 108 have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10-9 to 102 s, revealing the coexistence of fast (τ ? 20 ns) and slow (τ ? 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the {NW} surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t {\textless} 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of {ZnO} {NW} photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products ({GB}) higher than ?10 {GHz}. The high gain and low power consumption of {NW} photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.},

The improvement in the photo-current resulted from the light scattering of embedded Ag nanoparticles. The I–V curve of n-{ZnO}/p-Si degraded after thermal treatment (A-{ZnO}/p-Si) because the silicon robbed the oxygen from {ZnO} to form amorphous silicon dioxide and left an oxygen vacancy. Notably, the properties of {ZnO}/nano-{PAg}/p-Si were better in the time-dependent photoresponse under 10 V bias.

The all-oxide {PV} approach is very attractive due to the chemical stability, nontoxicity, and abundance of many metal oxides that potentially allow manufacturing under ambient conditions. Already today, metal oxides ({MOs}) are widely used as components in {PV} cells such as transparent conducting front electrodes or electron-transport layers, while only very few {MOs} have been used as light absorbers. In this Perspective, we review recent developments of all-oxide {PV} systems, which until today were mostly based on Cu2O as an absorber. Furthermore, ferroelectric {BiFeO}3-based {PV} systems are discussed, which have recently attracted considerable attention. The performance of all-oxide {PV} cells is discussed in terms of general {PV} principles, and directions for progress are proposed, pointing toward the development of novel metal oxide semiconductors using combinatorial methods.},

We compare structures consisting of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) polymer in contact with three different types of {ZnO} layer: a flaat {ZnO} backing layer alone; vertically aligned {ZnO} nanorods on a {ZnO} backing layer; and {ZnO} nanoparticles on a {ZnO} backing layer. We use scanning electron microscopy, steady state and transient absorption spectroscopies, and photovoltaic device measurements to study the morphology, charge separation, recombination behavior and device performance of the three types of structures. We find that charge recombination in the structures containing vertically aligned {ZnO} nanorods is remarkably slow, with a half-life of several milliseconds, over 2 orders of magnitude slower than that for randomly oriented {ZnO} nanoparticles. A photovoltaic device based on the nanorod structure that has been treated with an amphiphilic dye before deposition of the P3HT polymer yields a power conversion efficiency over four times greater than that for a similar device based on the nanoparticle structure. The best {ZnO} nanorod:P3HT device yields a short circuit current density of 2 {mAcm}(-2) under {AM}1.5 illumination (100 {mW} cm(-2)) and a peak external quantum efficiency over 14\%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 0.20\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract {ZnO}-graphene quasi core-shell quantum dot ({QD}) structures in which the inner {ZnO} {QDs} are covered with graphene nanoshells have been synthesized via a simple solution process method. The outer graphene nanoshells were identified as a single graphene layer using high resolution transmission electron microscopy ({HR}-{TEM}). Zn-O-C (graphene) chemical bonds between the inner {ZnO} {QDs} and the oxygen-containing functional groups introduced into the graphene layer are believed to be important in the formation of the consolidated quasi core-shell {QD} structure. A multilayer structure organic ultraviolet ({UV}) photovoltaic ({PV}) device was fabricated using {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} as the absorption layer. A quenching behavior as large as 71\% near the {UV} emission peak for the {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} was observed in the photoluminescence. Density of state ({DOS}) calculations for the graphene using density functional theory ({DFT}) revealed that the static quenching can be attributed to a faster charge separation via the direct electron transfer from the conduction band ({CB}) of the {ZnO} {QDs} to the induced lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ({LUMO}) of the graphene nanoshell resulting from the Zn-O-C bonding. This charge separation mechanism was confirmed experimentally using time-correlated single photon counting ({TCSPC}) measurements. The calculated average lifetime of 0.13 ns and 0.165 ns of the 375 and 383 nm {UV} emissions, respectively, for the {ZnO}-graphene core-shell {QDs} were approximately 10 times faster than those of 1.86 ns and 1.83 nm for the reference {ZnO} {QDs}; this is indicative of the existence of an additional high efficiency relaxation channel. The observed saturation current density (J sc), open circuit voltage (V oc), fill factor ({FF}), and power conversion efficiency (η) were 196.4 μA/cm2, 0.99 V, 0.24, and 2.33\%, respectively. In this study, it was found that the {UV} power conversion efficiency of {ZnO} {QDs} could be significantly improved by invoking a fast photoinduced charge separation and the subsequent transport of carriers to the collecting electrodes through conjugation with highly conductive graphene nanoshell acceptors to the {ZnO} {QDs} donor.

	abstract = {Tungsten trioxide ({WO}3) electrochromic coatings have been formed on indium tin oxide-coated glass substrates by aqueous routes. Coating sols are obtained by dissolving tungsten powder in acetylated ({APTA}) or plain peroxotungstic acid ({PTA}) solutions. The structural evolution and electrochromic performance of the coatings as a function of calcination temperature (250 °C and 400 °C) have been reported. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction have shown that amorphous {WO}3 films are formed after calcination at 250 °C for both processing routes; however, the coatings that calcined at 400 °C were crystalline in both cases. The calcination temperature-dependent crystallinity of the coatings results in differences in optical properties of the coatings. Higher coloration efficiencies can be achieved with amorphous coatings than could be seen in the crystalline coatings. The transmittance values (at 800 nm) in the colored state are 35\% and 56\% for 250 °C and 400 °C-calcined coatings, respectively. The electrochemical properties are more significantly influenced by the method of sol preparation. The ion storage capacities designating the electrochemical properties are found in the range of 1.62–2.74 × 10− 3 ({mC} cm− 2) for {APTA} coatings; and 0.35–1.62 × 10− 3 ({mC} cm− 2) for {PTA} coatings. As a result, a correlation between the microstructure and the electrochromic performance has been established.},

	abstract = {{WO}3 thin layers with nanometer-scale periodicity were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly ({EISA}) using a novel amphiphilic block-copolymer template (poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)). The evolution of the mesoporous ordered network and the crystallinity of the framework were monitored by 2D-{SAXS}, {WAXS}, {SEM}, {XPS}, and porosimetry. By annealing the films, the pore-wall crystallinity is adjusted between fully amorphous and highly crystalline without mesostructural degradation. Thus, the crystalline-film framework is composed of phase-pure monoclinic {WO}3 nanoparticles (12–14 nm in size). Furthermore, heat treatment transforms the originally spherical mesopores into ellipsoids, resulting in a unidirectionally shrunken, but still well-defined and fully accessible bcc mesopore architecture. The influence of mesoporosity and crystallinity on electrochemical/electrochromic characteristics was addressed by monitoring electrochemical features and the absorption changes during Li insertion/extraction (repetitive potentiostatic cycling). Both the amorphous and crystalline mesoporous films possess electrochromic response times on the order of only seconds, which are attributable to the facilitated insertion of guest ions due to shortening of the diffusion path lengths. Also, the insertion/extraction reversibility of crystalline {WO}3 layers with 3D mesoporosity is improved compared to amorphous ones and reaches values close to 100 \%.},

	abstract = {Vanadium oxide gel was synthesized and formulated for the assembly of solid-state electrochromic cells on flexible and transparent electrodes using inkjet printing. {FTIR}, Raman, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopic measurements showed that the vanadium oxide gel here synthesized consisted of V2O5·6H2O, microstructures similar to orthorhombic V2O5, while Raman spectroscopy also shows the presence of amorphous domains. Atomic force microscopy ({AFM}) images of the thin films printed using an inkjet shows a ribbonlike structure, which is in accordance with previous results of the vanadium oxide gels in solution. Solid-state electrochromic devices were assembled at room temperature using the inkjet printed films, without any sinterization step. The electrochemical properties of the vanadium oxide gel were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry by visible/{NIR} absorption spectroscopy (in both liquid and solid-state). Several redox steps are observed, which gives rise to a variety of color transitions as a function of the applied voltage. The different optical properties of the vanadium oxide gel are assigned to different intercalation steps of Li+, leading to different crystalline phases of the gel. The final result is a solid-state electrochromic cell showing excellent contrast between the redox states, giving rise to colors such as yellow, green, or blue. Color space analysis was used to characterize the electrochromic transitions, and while absorption spectra showed rather long switching times (up to 100 s), in L*a*b* color space coordinates, the switching time is smaller than 30 s. These electrochromic cells also have an excellent cycling stability showing high reversibility and a cyclability up to more than 30?000 cycles with a degradation of 18\%.},

	abstract = {The microstructural aspects related to crystalline or amorphous structure of as-deposited and annealed films of sol–gel-derived {WO}3 are shown in the literature to be critical for electrochromic ({EC}) performance. In consideration of ion insertion materials, there is a need for developing light and at the same time nanocrystalline structures to improve both coloration efficiency and switching kinetics. By controlling microstructure and morphology, one could design a material with optimal {EC} performance. This report compares the microstructural and morphological characteristics of standard {WO}3 wet deposition techniques versus inkjet printing technology ({IPT}), correlating these features with their optical and electrochemical performances, emphasizing the importance of the dual-phase a-{WO}3/{TiO}2/{WOX} film composition proposed in this work for high-performance {EC} applications. The effect of the type and content of metal oxide nanoparticles in the precursor sols formulated in various peroxopolytungstic acid ({PTA}) and oxalic acid ({OAD}) proportions on film properties is comprehensively studied using multi-factorial design of experiment ({DOE}). To the authors' knowledge, no other report on sol–gel deposition of inorganic {EC} materials via the inkjet printing technique exists, in which furthermore the film crystallinity can be controlled under low-temperature process conditions. The proposed method enables development of {EC} films which irrespective of their composition (a-{WO}3, a-{WO}3/{TiO}2 or a-{WO}3/{TiO}2/{WOX}) outperform their amorphous or nanocrystalline analogues presented as the state-of-the-art due to their superior chemical and physical properties.},

	abstract = {The growth and epitaxy of Ag and Ag2O films on r-cut sapphire surfaces is reported for several different growth conditions. Ag was deposited by electron beam evaporation in vacuum, in a molecular O2 background, and in the presence of an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) oxygen plasma. The presence of an oxygen background converts the random polycrystalline growth of Ag in vacuum to three dimensional epitaxial growth of Ag with a 〈110〉 surface normal. At sufficiently low deposition rates (0.1 nm/s), the presence of the ECR oxygen plasma leads to the growth of Ag2O films with a one dimensional epitaxy having the 〈111〉 direction normal to the surface but random orientation about this normal. The effects of thermal decomposition of Ag2O were examined by annealing the samples in vacuum above 625 K and characterizing the surfaces with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to observe the segregation of silver into islands as the Ag2O decomposes.},

	abstract = {To help understand the high activity of silver as an oxidation catalyst, e.g., for the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide and the dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde, the interaction and stability of many different oxygen species at the Ag(111) surface has been studied for a wide range of coverages. Through calculation of the free energy, as obtained from density-functional theory and taking into account the temperature and pressure via the oxygen chemical potential, we obtain the phase diagram of O/Ag(111). Our results reveal that a thin surface-oxide structure is most stable for the temperature and pressure range of ethylene epoxidation and we propose it (and possibly other similar structures) contains the species actuating the catalysis. For higher temperatures, low coverages of chemisorbed oxygen are most stable, which could also play a role in oxidation reactions. For temperatures greater than about 775 K there are no stable oxygen species, except for the possibility of O atoms adsorbed at undercoordinated surface sites (i.e., imperfections, defects). At low temperatures (≲400K at atmospheric pressure), provided kinetic limitations can be overcome, thicker oxidelike structures are predicted. Due to their low thermal stability, however, they can be ruled out as playing an important role in the heterogeneous reactions under technical conditions. Bulk dissolved oxygen and a molecular ozonelike species adsorbed at a surface vacancy, as have been proposed in the literature, are found to be energetically unfavorable. The employed theoretical approach for calculating free energies and predicting the lowest energy structures in contact with species in the environment (“ab initio, atomistic thermodynamics”), affords investigation of a system that seamlessly connects standard (T=0K) density-functional theory results, characteristic of “typical” theoretical surface science studies, through to those valid for the conditions of catalysis. Though the error bar of the noted theoretical temperatures is noticeable (±≈55K), the identified trends and physical descriptions are useful.},

Since the band-bending under illumination varies relatively small for an Au NP-decorated ZnO NW, the decay of gain is less prominent with increased excitation power, demonstrating the feasibility for a PD to maintain a high gain under high-power illumination.},

	abstract = {ZnO has emerged as a promising candidate for optoelectronic and microelectronic applications, whose development requires greater understanding and control of their electronic contacts. The rapid pace of ZnO research over the past decade has yielded considerable new information on the nature of ZnO interfaces with metals. Work on ZnO contacts over the past decade has now been carried out on high quality material, nearly free from complicating factors such as impurities, morphological and native point defects. Based on the high quality bulk and thin film crystals now available, ZnO exhibits a range of systematic interface electronic structure that can be understood at the atomic scale. Here we provide a comprehensive review of Schottky barrier and ohmic contacts including work extending over the past half century. For Schottky barriers, these results span the nature of ZnO surface charge transfer, the roles of surface cleaning, crystal quality, chemical interactions, and defect formation. For ohmic contacts, these studies encompass the nature of metal-specific interactions, the role of annealing, multilayered contacts, alloyed contacts, metallization schemes for state-of-the-art contacts, and their application to n-type versus p-type ZnO. Both ZnO Schottky barriers and ohmic contacts show a wide range of phenomena and electronic behavior, which can all be directly tied to chemical and structural changes on an atomic scale.},

Compared to the theoretical value of n-type ZnO, the higher Richardson constant was obtained for both polar faces in the modified Richardson plot, indicating that the TE model, which considers barrier inhomogeneity, cannot adequately explain the current transport. Temperature-dependent tunneling characteristics showed that the tunneling current was dominant for the Zn-polar face over the entire temperature range (100–300 K).

Pt- and Ag-gate MESFETs show excellent electric properties with on/off-ratios of 4.5 × 106 and 1.1 × 108, respectively, and low off-currents in the picoampere range. The leakage currents for Pd- and Au-MESFETs are 2 and 4 orders of magnitude higher than for Ag. Maximum off-voltages of − 1.4 V have to be applied at the gate in order to fully close the n-type (normally-on) channels.

Studies of the device performance at elevated temperatures in the range between 25 °C and 150 °C revealed that the MESFETs are stable at least until 75 °C. An annealing effect, which improved the MESFET's electric properties, could be observed for Ag, Pt, and Au.},

	abstract = {The temperature dependent electrical properties of Ag Schottky contacts to a-plane bulk ZnO single crystal were investigated in the temperature range of 100-300 K. The variation in the barrier heights was described by a double Gaussian distribution with two different regions in the temperature range of 200-300 and 100-180 K. The modified Richardson plot in the temperature range of 200-300 K produced the Richardson constant of 29 A cm(-2) K-2 which is similar to the theoretical value of 32 A cm(-2) K-2 for n-type ZnO, indicating that the inhomogeneous barrier height with the thermionic emission model can explain the current transport well in this region. Below 200 K, the bulk carriers start to freeze out and the induced oxygen vacancies in the interface region, probably due to the formation of silver oxide at the Ag-ZnO interface, will influence significantly the current transport by creating very thin interfacial layer that is susceptible to electron tunneling.

	abstract = {Highly sensitive metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) UV photodetectors are demonstrated based on ZnO/SiO2 core–shell nanowires. The MIS devices possess simplicity in material synthesis, technological advantages in the device design and uniqueness in the prevailing mechanism. We propose that inserting an insulating SiO2 layer between the metal and photoconductive semiconductor could significantly reduce the dark current resulting in a very high photocurrent to dark current ratio. The photoconductive MIS devices showed a remarkably high photocurrent immediate decay (∼99.9\%), photo/dark current ratio (∼4–5 orders), and photoresponse speed (\&lt;100 ms). Furthermore the optical emission properties of ZnO core–shell nanowires are tuned by controlling the dimensions of the ZnO core or the SiO2 shell. The mechanism for this enhanced photoconductivity is suggested to occur by photo-excited electron-hole generation and it's tunnelling through the insulating layer by electron hopping through multiple defect energy states of the SiO2 shell resulting in a large increase of electron–hole pairs. The exploitation of this device structure and material synthesis in other photoconductive nanostructures or insulators with similar traits could result in the low cost fabrication of highly sensitive photodetectors and switches.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been substantial interest in the study on the electronic properties of hybrid structures. In particular, ZnO nanorods are a good n-type material that can be formed at low temperature using solution deposition techniques complementing the availability of numerous p-type organic semiconductors. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that ZnO nanorods can act as efficient electron injectors making them ideally suitable for use in opto-electronic devices such as the light-emitting diodes and transistors. This work examined the electronic properties of ZnO nanorods deposited using spin coating and hydrothermal techniques as an n-type layer and we measured the carrier density and mobility using thermoelectric and Hall measurements. In the context of a hetero-structure device, we used the ZnO nanorods to form metal–insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diodes and measured the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics. Our results suggested that the semiconductor-insulator interface was in depletion at equilibrium and moved away from depletion at both positive and negative (gate) biases. The computed carrier density based on the C–V measurements was essentially the same as what was found in the thermoelectric measurements leading to the argument that charge flow in the MIS structures had been primarily along the long axes of the nanorods. The dynamic C–V characteristics also suggested that there could be substantial (negative) charge states at the insulator-semiconductor interface that readily supplied electrons to the depletion layer.},

	abstract = {The performance of metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) type tunneling diodes based on ZnO nanostructures is investigated through modeling. The framework used in this work is the Schrödinger equation with an effective-mass approximation. The working mechanism of the MIS type tunneling diode is investigated by examining the electron density, electric field, electrostatic potential, and conduction band edge of the device. We show that a valley in the electrostatic potential is formed at the ZnO/MgO interface, which induces an energy barrier at the ZnO side of this interface. Therefore, electrons need to overcome two barriers: the high and narrow MgO barrier, and the barrier from the depletion region induced at the ZnO side of the ZnO/MgO interface. As the MgO layer becomes thicker, the valley in electrostatic potential becomes deeper. At the same time, the barrier induced at the ZnO/MgO interface becomes higher and wider. This leads to a fast decrease in the current passing through the MIS diode. We optimize the thickness of the MgO insulating layer, sandwiched between a ZnO film (in this work we use a single ZnO nanowire) and a metal contact, to achieve maximum performance of the diode, in terms of rectification ratio. An optimal MgO layer thickness of 1.5 nm is found to yield the highest rectification ratio, of approximately 169 times that of a conventional metal–semiconductor–metal Schottky diode. These simulated results can be useful in the design and optimization of ZnO nanodevices, such as light emitting diodes and UV photodetectors.},

Band structures of amorphous SiO2/m-plane ZnO(1 (1) over bar 100) heterointerface have been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, showing type I band configuration with valence and conduction band offsets of 1.7 +/- 0.2 and 3.6 +/- 0.2 eV, respectively. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements of Al/SiO2/m-plane ZnO(1 (1) over bar 100) have been performed. When gate bias was swept from positive to negative, a ledge appeared in the C-V curve of the Al/SiO2/m-plane ZnO structure, which is probably due to the emission of electrons trapped at the near-midgap deep levels. However, it is found that the surface treatment for ZnO using HCl yielding automatically flat stepped and terraced surface improves the C-V curve without the ledge.

This is because oxide insulators exhibit very low electron affinity and high ionization energy levels. Here we show that a ZnO layer acting as a cathode buffer layer permits direct electron injection into the conduction bands of various oxide insulators (for example, SiO2, Ta2O5, HfO2, Al2O3) from a metal cathode. Studies of current-voltage characteristics reveal that the current ohmically passes through the ZnO/oxide-insulator interface. Our findings suggests that the oxide insulators could be used for simply fabricated, transparent and highly stable electronic valves. With this strategy, we demonstrate an electrostatic discharging diode that uses 100-nm SiO2 as an active layer exhibiting an on/off ratio of similar to 10(7), and protects the ZnO thin-film transistors from high electrical stresses.},

We introduce a sputtered ZnO seed layer followed by the sequential electrodeposition of ZnO and Cu2O films. The seed layer is employed to control the growth and crystallinity and to augment the surface area of the electrodeposited ZnO films, thereby tuning the quality of the ZnO–Cu2O heterointerface. Additionally, the seed layer also assists in forming high quality ZnO films, with no pin-holes, in a high pH electrolyte solution. X-ray electron diffraction patterns, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy images, as well as photovoltaic measurements, clearly demonstrate that the incorporation of certain seed layers results in the alteration of the heterointerface quality, a change in the heterojunction area and the crystallinity of the films near the junction, which influence the current density of photovoltaic devices.},

It was found that this Ga2O3 thin film can greatly improve the performance of Cu2O-based heterojunction solar cells fabricated using polycrystalline Cu2O sheets that had been prepared by a thermal oxidization of copper sheets. The obtained photovoltaic properties in the AZO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells were strongly dependent on the deposition conditions of the Ga2O3 films. The external quantum efficiency obtained in AZO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells was found to be greater at wavelengths below approximately 500 nm than that obtained in AZO/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells (i.e., prepared without a Ga2O3 layer) at equivalent wavelengths. This improvement of photovoltaic properties is mainly attributed to a decrease in the level of defects at the interface between the Ga2O3 thin film and the Cu2O sheet. Conversion efficiencies over 5\% were obtained in AZO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells fabricated using an n-Ga2O3 thin-film layer prepared with a thickness of 40–80 nm at an O2 gas pressure of approximately 1.7 Pa by a pulsed laser deposition.},

Combinatorial hetero-junction libraries consisting of a linear TiO2 thickness gradient produced by spray pyrolysis and a bell shaped Cu2O profile synthesized by pulsed laser deposition were chosen to investigate the impact of the two metal oxide layer thicknesses. The back contacts were deposited as round patches onto a grid of 13 × 13 points, 169 contacts for each contact material, forming a library containing 4 × 13 × 13 = 676 back contacts. Each back contact represented a solar cell with an individual TiO2 and Cu2O thickness. I–V measurements show that all four materials provide an ohmic contact and that the open circuit voltage of 300 mV is rather independent of both layer thicknesses and contact material. The size of the Cu2O crystals drastically decreases with distance from the center of deposition, which leads to a drastic increase of series resistance when the crystal size is {\textless}50 nm.},

	abstract = {All-oxide-based photovoltaics (PVs) encompass the potential for extremely low cost solar cells, provided they can obtain an order of magnitude improvement in their power conversion efficiencies. To achieve this goal, we perform a combinatorial materials study of metal oxide based light absorbers, charge transporters, junctions between them, and PV devices. Here we report the development of a combinatorial internal quantum efficiency (IQE) method. IQE measures the efficiency associated with the charge separation and collection processes, and thus is a proxy for PV activity of materials once placed into devices, discarding optical properties that cause uncontrolled light harvesting. The IQE is supported by high-throughput techniques for bandgap fitting, composition analysis, and thickness mapping, which are also crucial parameters for the combinatorial investigation cycle of photovoltaics. As a model system we use a library of 169 solar cells with a varying thickness of sprayed titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the window layer, and covarying thickness and composition of binary compounds of copper oxides (Cu-O) as the light absorber, fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). The analysis on the combinatorial devices shows the correlation between compositions and bandgap, and their effect on PV activity within several device configurations. The analysis suggests that the presence of Cu4O3 plays a significant role in the PV activity of binary Cu-O compounds.},

An improvement of photovoltaic properties was achieved by both stabilizing the surface of polycrystalline p-Cu2O sheets that had been prepared by thermal oxidization of Cu sheets and also developing low-temperature and low-damage deposition technology for applying thin films as an n-oxide semiconductor layer. It should be noted that the obtainable photovoltaic properties in AZO/oxide semiconductor/Cu2O HbH solar cells were found to be considerably more affected by the surface condition of the p-Cu2O layer, i.e., the interface at the heterojunction, than the diffusion potential resulting from the difference of work functions between the p-Cu2O and n-oxide semiconductor layers. To achieve a higher efficiency in AZO/n-oxide semiconductor/p-Cu2O HbH solar cells, it was necessary to improve the interface at the heterojunction as well as reduce the series resistance and increase the parallel resistance of the HbH solar cells. The effect of the inserted n-oxide semiconductor thin film on the obtainable photovoltaic properties was investigated in the Cu2O-based HbH solar cells by inserting various kinds of n-oxide semiconductor thin films prepared under various deposition conditions using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Although either a nondoped ZnO or Ga2O3 thin film deposited at room temperature by PLD is suitable as the n-oxide semiconductor layer, an amorphous Ga2O3 thin film with a high resistivity was found to be the most suitable oxide. The improvement of the p–n junction, as seen in the Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction, could be achieved by decreasing the defect levels at the interface, which decreases not only the recombination associated with defects at the interface between the Ga2O3 and Cu2O, but also the conduction band discontinuity. We have achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of 5.38\% in an AZO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cell fabricated by depositing a Ga2O3 thin film on a Cu2O sheet with a resistivity on the order of 102 Ω cm.},

The all-oxide PV approach is very attractive due to the chemical stability, nontoxicity, and abundance of many metal oxides that potentially allow manufacturing under ambient conditions. Already today, metal oxides (MOs) are widely used as components in PV cells such as transparent conducting front electrodes or electron-transport layers, while only very few MOs have been used as light absorbers. In this Perspective, we review recent developments of all-oxide PV systems, which until today were mostly based on Cu2O as an absorber. Furthermore, ferroelectric BiFeO3-based PV systems are discussed, which have recently attracted considerable attention. The performance of all-oxide PV cells is discussed in terms of general PV principles, and directions for progress are proposed, pointing toward the development of novel metal oxide semiconductors using combinatorial methods.},

Such improvements require the development of new MOs which could benefit from combining combinatorial material sciences for producing solar cells libraries with data mining tools to direct synthesis efforts. In this work we developed a data mining workflow and applied it to the analysis of two recently reported solar cell libraries based on Titanium and Copper oxides. Our results demonstrate that QSAR models with good prediction statistics for multiple solar cells properties could be developed and that these models highlight important factors affecting these properties in accord with experimental findings. The resulting models are therefore suitable for designing better solar cells.},

These p-type semiconducting oxides prepared by Cu oxidation, sputtering or electrochemical deposition are non-toxic, sustainable photovoltaic materials with application potential for solar electricity. However, defects at the copper oxide heterojunction and film quality are still major constraining factors for achieving high power conversion efficiency, η. Amongst the Cu2O heterojunction devices, a maximum η of 6.1\% has been obtained by using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of AlxGa1−xO onto thermal Cu2O doped with Na. The performance of CuO/n-Si heterojunction solar cells formed by magnetron sputtering of CuO is presently limited by both native oxide and Cu rich copper oxide layers at the heterointerface. These interfacial layers can be reduced by using a two-step sputtering process. A high η of 2.88\% for CuO heterojunction solar cells has been achieved by incorporation of mixed phase CuO/Cu2O nanopowder. CuO/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells fabricated by electrodeposition and electrochemical doping has a maximum efficiency of 0.64\% after surface defect passivation and annealing.

The XRD, SEM and Raman, FTIR investigations reveal that ZnO:Mn (Mn - 3-5 wt\%) retained hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure with nanorod morphology. The HRTEM and SAED analysis confirm the single crystalline nature of hydrothermally grown ZnO and ZnO:Mn (5 wt\%) nanorods.

The blue shift of UV emission peak (PL) from 393 (ZnO) to 386nm and quenching of photoluminescence emission in ZnO:Mn is due to the Mn incorporation in ZnO lattice. Relative increase in intensity of Raman band at 660 cm(-1) with nominal doping of Mn 3-5 wt\% in ZnO indicate that defects are introduced in ZnO:Mn system as a result of doping that leads to the quenching of photoluminescence emission at 393 nm.

	abstract = {Thin film photovoltaics is a particularly attractive technology for building integration. In this paper, we present our analysis on architectural issues and technological developments of thin film silicon photovoltaics. In particular, we focus on our activities related to transparent and conductive oxide (TCO) and thin film amorphous and microcrystalline silicon solar cells. The research on TCO films is mainly dedicated to large-area deposition of zinc oxide (ZnO) by low pressure-metallorganic chemical vapor deposition. ZnO material, with a low sheet resistance (\&lt;8 Ω/sq) and with an excellent transmittance (\&gt;82\%) in the whole wavelength range of photovoltaic interest, has been obtained. “Micromorph” tandem devices, consisting of an amorphous silicon top cell and a microcrystalline silicon bottom cell, are fabricated by using the very high frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. An initial efficiency of 11.1\% (\&gt;10\% stabilized) has been obtained.},

The contact morphology roughens after annealing at 150 °C and Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling shows Zn outdiffusion through the metal and intermixing of Au and Ti. However, the morphology does not significantly worsen after anneals at 450 °C. This metallization scheme looks very attractive for the n-electrode of ZnO-based light-emitting diode structures.},

It was found that TiO was produced, and the atomic ratio of Zn/O was dramatically increased after annealing at 300°C. This provides the evidence that a number of oxygen vacancies, acting as donors for electrons, were produced below the contact.

The annealed films are constituted of nanorods along with interconnected nanoparticles and pores. While the high transmission modulation and colouration efficiency in the visible region and the fast bleaching kinetics as shown by the nanostructured film were typical of amorphous WO 3 , the absorption coefficient spread in the 300–2000 nm wavelength range, the reflectance modulation and the colouration efficiency peak in the NIR region were reminiscent of crystalline WO 3 . The larger magnitude of the indirect band gap shift to blue than the direct gap shift for the same level of lithium intercalation (18 mC cm −2 ) and the irreversibility of the direct gap shift upon bleaching are characteristic of the nanocrystalline structure of the film. The moderate decline in the anodic peak current maximum, the diffusion coefficient for lithium and the optical modulation at 632.8 nm upon repetitive switching between the coloured and bleached states ratified that nanostructured films sustain 1000 cycles without much deterioration.},

Furthermore, photovoltage evolution and WF of selected ZnO samples were measured using a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) system.

Optical parameters such as optical transmittance, reflectance, band tail, dielectric coefficient, refractive index, energy band gap have been studied, discussed and correlated to the changes with film thickness. Kramers–Kronig and dispersion relations were employed to determine the complex refractive index and dielectric constants using reflection data in the ultraviolet–visible–near infrared regions. Films with optical transmittance above 90\% in the visible range were prepared at pressure of 6.5 × 10−4 Torr. XRD analysis revealed that all films had a strong ZnO (0 0 2) peak, indicating c-axis orientation. The crystal grain size increased from 14.97 nm to 22.53 nm as the film thickness increased from 139 nm to 427 nm, however no significant change was observed in interplanar distance and crystal lattice constant. Optical energy gap decreased from 3.21 eV to 3.19 eV with increasing the thickness. The transmission in UV region decreased with the increase of film thickness. The refractive index, Urbach tail and real part of complex dielectric constant decreased as the film thickness increased.

Design of Experiment (DOE) was used for statistical multivariate analysis and prediction of mixtures through a multiple regression model, as well as the optimization of a five-component sol?gel precursor subjected to complex constraints. This approach significantly reduces the number of experiments to be realized, from 162 in the full factorial (L = 3) and 72 in the extreme vertices (D = 2) approach down to only 30 runs, while still maintaining a high accuracy of the analysis. By carrying out a finite number of experiments, the empirical modeling in this study shows reasonably good prediction ability in terms of the overall EC performance. An optimized ink formulation was employed in a prototype of a passive EC matrix fabricated in order to test and trial this optically active material system together with a solid-state electrolyte for the prospective application in EC displays. Coupling of DOE with chromogenic material formulation shows the potential to maximize the capabilities of these systems and ensures increased productivity in many potential solution-processed electrochemical applications.},

Following our recent work on a.c. conductivity in AlZnOAl sandwich structures we currently report d.c. measurements. The structures were prepared by r.f. magnetron sputtering in an argon/oxygen mixture in the ratio 4:1. Capacitance-voltage data confirm that the AlZnO interface does not form a Schottky barrier and measurements of the dependence of capacitance on film thickness indicate that the relative permittivity of the films is approximately 9.7. With increasing voltage the current density changed from an ohmic to a power-law dependence with exponent n≈3. Furthermore measurements of current density as a function of reciprocal temperature showed a linear dependence above about 240 K, with a very low activation energy below this temperature consistent with a hopping process. The higher temperature results may be explained assuming a room-temperature electron concentration n0 and space-charge-limited conductivity, dominated by traps exponentially distributed with energy E below the conduction band edge according to N = N0exp(−EkTt), where k is Boltzmann's constant. Typical derived values of these parameters are: n0 = 7.2 × 1016 m−3, N0 = 1.31 × 1045 J−1 m−3 and Tt = 623 K. The total trap concentration and the electron mobility were estimated to be 1.13 × 1025 m−3 and (5.7−13.1) ×10−3m2V−1s−1 respectively.},

Detailed and systematic analysis of the frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements was performed to extract the information about the interface trap states. The discrepancy between the high barrier height values obtained from the I-V and the C-V measurements was also analyzed. The higher capacitance at low frequencies was attributed to excess capacitance as a result of interface states in equilibrium in the ZnO that can follow the alternating current signal. The energy of the interface states (Ess) with respect to the valence band at the ZnO NR surface was also calculated. The densities of interface states obtained from the conductance and capacitance methods agreed well with each other and this confirm that the observed capacitance and conductance are caused by the same physical processes, i.e., recombination-generation in the interface states.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the electronic relaxation of deep bulk trap and interface state in ZnO ceramics based on dielectric spectra measured in a wide range of temperature, frequency and bias, in addition to the steady state response. It discusses the nature of net current flowing over the barrier affected by interface state, and then obtains temperature-dependent barrier height by approximate calculation from steady I — V (current—voltage) characteristics. Additional conductance and capacitance arising from deep bulk trap relaxation are calculated based on the displacement of the cross point between deep bulk trap and Fermi level under small AC signal. From the resonances due to deep bulk trap relaxation on dielectric spectra, the activation energies are obtained as 0.22 eV and 0.35 eV, which are consistent with the electronic levels of the main defect interstitial Zn and vacancy oxygen in the depletion layer. Under moderate bias, another resonance due to interface relaxation is shown on the dielectric spectra. The DC-like conductance is also observed in high temperature region on dielectric spectra, and the activation energy is much smaller than the barrier height in steady state condition, which is attributed to the displacement current coming from the shallow bulk trap relaxation or other factors.},

The ZnO:Co films have a microfiber structure and the structure of microfibers was changed with the cobalt dopant.

The characteristic parameters of the structure such as barrier height, ideality factor and series resistance were determined from the current–voltage measurements. Also, Cheung functions and Norde method were used to plot the I–V characteristics and, to extract the characteristic parameters of the Schottky contact. It was seen that trap-filled space charge-limited current (SCLC) is the dominant transport mechanism at large forward bias. The capacitance measurements showed that the values of capacitance were almost independent of frequency up to a certain value of frequency whereas at high frequencies the capacitance decreased quickly. The higher values of capacitance at low frequencies were attributed to the excess capacitance resulting from the interface states in equilibrium with the ZnO that can follow the alternating current (ac) signal.},

	abstract = {Interface states density (N SS ) distribution is extracted in Au/ ZnO Schottky diodes. Nanorods of ZnO are grown on silver (Ag) using aqueous chemical growth (ACG) technique. Well aligned hexagonal–shaped vertical nanorods of a mean diameter of 300 - 450 nm and 1.3 -1.9 μm high are revealed in SEM. Gold (Au) Schottky contacts of thickness 60 nm and 1.5mm diameter were evaporated. For electrical characterization of Schottky diodes current-voltage ( I-V ) and capacitance-Voltage ( C-V ) measurements are performed. The diodes exhibited a typical non-linear rectifying behavior with a barrier height of 0.62eV and ideality factor of 4.3. Possible reasons for low barrier height and high ideality factor have been addressed. Series resistance (R S ) has been calculated from forward I-V characteristics using Chueng's function. The density of interfacial states (N SS ) below the conduction band (E C -E SS ) is extracted using I-V and C-V measured values. A decrease in interface states density (N SS ) is observed from 3.74 × 10 11 − 7.98 × 10 10 eV −1 cm −2 from 0.30eV - 0.61eV below the conduction band edge.},

	abstract = {Linear, paraelectric (Pb0.72La0.28)TiO3 or PLT(28) thin films with a bandgap{\textgreater}3 eV were deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by the sol-gel technique. Specific top-contact metals from two distinct groups (i.e., non-noble or M T and noble or M N; the former being oxidizable transition metals) were selected to understand the electrical nature of the interfaces in terms of electrode dependent energy band diagrams and equivalent circuit models. Using a high sensitivity high-pass filter circuit to evaluate the charging and discharging behavior coupled with results of the thickness and voltage dependence of capacitance, it was determined that M T ( Ni,Cr,Ti) and M N ( Pt,Au,Ag) metals form Ohmic and Schottky contacts, respectively. Supported by thermochemical data and calculations, the ohmic M T- PLT interfaces are envisioned to be of the form: M T-M T Ox-n+ PLT-n PLT. In contrast, the M N- PLT interfaces may be characterized by a metal work function independent Schottky diode; the surface Fermi level being pinned at the mid-gap. For example, a Schottky barrier height of 1.83 eV and a built-in voltage of 1.3 eV at the Pt-PLT interface were estimated. From low field capacitance measurements, the ratio of interfacial to bulk resistance, R i/R b, was estimated to be 23.},

The annealing atmosphere and temperature were found to strongly affect the yellow and orange-red defect emissions, while green emission was not significantly affected by annealing. The defect emissions exhibited a strong dependence on the temperature and excitation wavelength, with some defect emissions observable only at low temperatures and for certain excitation wavelengths. The yellow emission in samples prepared by a hydrothermal method is likely due to the presence of OH groups, instead of the commonly assumed interstitial oxygen defect. The green and orange-red emissions are likely due to donor acceptor transitions involving defect complexes, which likely include zinc vacancy complexes in the case of orange-red emissions.},

With the emergence of a multitude of nanostructured photovoltaic (nano-PV) device architectures, the question has arisen of where both the practical and the fundamental limits of performance reside in these new systems. Here, the former is addressed a posteriori. The specific challenges associated with improving the electrical power conversion efficiency of various nano-PV technologies are discussed and several approaches to reduce their thermal losses beyond the single bandgap limit are reviewed. Critical considerations related to the module lifetime and cost that are unique to nano-PV architectures are also addressed. The analysis suggests that a practical single-junction laboratory power conversion efficiency limit of 17\% and a two-cell tandem power conversion efficiency limit of 24\% are possible for nano-PVs, which, when combined with operating lifetimes of 10 to 15 years, could position them as a transformational technology for solar energy markets.},

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semi?transparent plastic solar cells still lags behind due to the lack of a suitable transparent top electrode which can be easily fabricated. Here, we demonstrate high performance semi?transparent plastic solar cells by introducing an oxide?metal?oxide (OMO) multilayer composed of MoO3 and Ag as a transparent top electrode. Because the conductivity of the OMO electrode is governed by an intermediate Ag layer sandwiched between 2 MoO3 layers, the PCE also strongly depends on the thickness of the intermediate Ag layer in the OMO electrode. By controlling the thickness of Ag layer, we obtained various PCE values from 4.5\% with {\textasciitilde}50\% maximum transparency in the visible region to 9.1\% with {\textasciitilde}5\% maximum transparency in the visible region. In addition, in order to get closer to practical application, 2 sizes of mini?module devices were fabricated on a larger (10.0~cm~?~10.0~cm) substrate for outdoor operation and small?sized (7.0~cm~?~5.0~cm) substrates for indoor operation were demonstrated using 3 materials of different color.},

Is it possible, in order to satisfy the on-site energy production, to install the transparent solar cell into the window of buildings and vehicles without recognizing the existence of energy harvesting entities? Here we propose and demonstrate the wide energy bandgap materials for visible light transmittance and UV photon absorption for power generation. All-transparent solar cell was achieved by the heterojunction of metal oxide layers. By using the solid-state sputtering method, transparent heterojunction (p-type NiO/n-type ZnO) was realized. A unit cell gave the record-high conversion efficiency of 6\% with the enormous current density (2.7mA/cm2) and open circuit voltage of 532mV. The remarkable transparent solar power is mainly attributed to the absolute UV absorption to induce the substantial excitonic effect for ZnO/NiO heterojunction. For integration, the transparent solar cell units were fabricated on a glass substrate to demonstrate the module of unit solar cells. Using the 3 {\texttimes} 3 unit cell solar module, a significant output voltage ({\textgreater} 2V) was achieved to confirm the excellent connection manipulation of transparent solar cell units. By putting the transparent solar cells on buildings and vehicles, the electric power is spontaneously supplied from the Sun power but human eyes have no visible scarification. Transparent solar cells would provide a route for on-site energy generation.},

A simple expression is obtained for the dependence of the open circuit voltage on the interfacial parameters, which is in agreement with experimental results on Au-Si MIS-SB solar cells, for which the interfacial parameters are reasonably well known. The rather puzzling observation that the dark (majority-carrier) current is reduced by the interfacial layer, without at the same time decreasing the short circuit (minority-carrier) current is explained without having to assume any asymmetry in the tunneling probabilities for electrons and holes. The theoretical prediction for the maximum thickness of the interfacial layer (20 {\r A}) for a constant short-circuit current and maximum conversion efficiency is also in good agreement with experiment.},

	abstract = {Hybrid organo-metal halide perovskites are an exciting new class of solar absorber materials and have exhibited a rapid increase in solar cell efficiencies throughout the past two years to over 17\% in both meso-structured and thin-film device architectures. We observe slow transient effects causing hysteresis in the current–voltage characterization of these devices that can lead to an over- or underestimation of the solar cell device efficiency. We find that the current–voltage (IV) measurement scan direction, measurement delay time, and light and voltage bias conditions prior to measurement can all have a significant impact upon the shape of the measured IV light curves and the apparent device efficiency. We observe that hysteresis-free light IV curves can be obtained at both extremely fast and slow voltage scan rates but only in the latter case are quasi-steady-state conditions achieved for a valid power conversion efficiency measurement. Hysteretic effects are also observed in devices utilizing alternative selective contacts but differ in magnitude and time scale, suggesting that the contact interfaces have a big effect on transients in perovskite-absorber devices. The transient processes giving rise to hysteresis are consistent with a polarization response of the perovskite absorber that results in changes in the photocurrent extraction efficiency of the device. The strong dependence of the hysteresis on light and voltage biasing conditions in thin film devices for a period of time prior to the measurement suggests that photo-induced ion migration may additionally play an important role in device hysteresis. Based on these observations, we provide recommendations for correct measurement and reporting of IV curves for perovskite solar cell devices.},

This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current–voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.},

The HP memristor is based on a nanometer scale TiO\$\_2\$ thin-film, containing a doped region and an undoped region. Further to proposed applications of memristors in artificial biological systems and nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM), they also enable reconfigurable nanoelectronics. Moreover, memristors provide new paradigms in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A significant reduction in area with an unprecedented memory capacity and device density are the potential advantages of memristors for Integrated Circuits (ICs). This work reviews the memristor and provides mathematical and SPICE models for memristors. Insight into the memristor device is given via recalling the quasi-static expansion of Maxwell's equations. We also review Chua's arguments based on electromagnetic theory.},

Effect of the current compliance (CC) in the NDR switching of the fabricated switch has been demonstrated. Multiple resistive switching sweeps were taken to scrutinize the robustness of the fabricated device over 100 cycles. The non-volatility of the as-fabricated device was checked against different time stresses over 2500 s. The switching mechanism is proposed to be due to the transition between PEDOT+ and PEDOT0 chains. The current conduction mechanism involved in the PEDOT:PSS based NDR switches is attributed to the ohmic conduction at lower voltages, while space charge limited conduction and NDR effects were prominent due to the injection of carriers at higher voltages.},

Formic acid treated PEDOT:PSS films also exhibited very high transmittances. The mechanism of conductivity enhancement was explored through SEM, AFM, and XPS. Formic acid with its high dielectric constant screens the charge between PEDOT and PSS bringing about phase separation between them. Increased carrier concentration, removal of PSS from the film, morphology, and conformation change with elongated and better connected PEDOT chains are the main mechanisms of conductivity enhancement. ITO-free polymer solar cells were also fabricated using PEDOT:PSS electrodes treated with different concentrations of formic acid and showed equal performance to that of ITO electrodes.

We have studied devices consisting of 20 nm copper phthalocyanine as buffer and hole-injection layer, 50 nm N,N′ -di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N′ diphenyl-benzidine (NPB) as hole-transport layer, and 65 nm tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq 3 ) as electron transport and emitting layer sandwiched between a high-work-function metal and a semitransparent Ca electrode. Current–voltage measurements show that the device characteristics in negative bias direction and at low positive bias are influenced by charges trapped within the organic layers. This is manifested by a strong dependence of the current on the direction and speed of the voltage sweep in this range. Low-frequency capacitance–voltage and static chargemeasurements reveal a voltage-independent capacitance in negative bias direction and a significant increase between 0 and 2 V, indicating the presence of negative interfacial charges at the NPB/Alq 3 interface. Transient experiments show that the delay time of electroluminescence under forward bias conditions is controlled by the buildup of internal space charges rather than by charge-carriertransport through the organic layers.},

Significant differences have been observed in the photoelectron spectra between as-prepared chemically neutralized and anion-doped PEDOT thin films. The electronic structures of as-prepared neutral and doped PEDOT obtained from the photoelectron spectra are in good agreement with the results of new quantum chemical electronic structure calculations. No significant thermal-induced effects have been detected for either as-prepared neutral or doped PEDOT films. The concentration of anions on the polymer surface depends upon the size of the anion, with large anions, like polystyrene sulfonate (PSS−) base, being much more likely to cover the surface of a PEDOT film than small anion, such as tosylate(p-methyl benzyl sulfonate). This surface concentration effect probably makes the large-anion-doped polymer a more suitable candidate as an electrode in polymer light-emitting diodes (LEDs) than the small-anion-doped polymer.},

When a large anodic potential is applied to the conducting polymer blend poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(4styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS, an over-oxidation reaction occurs, altering its electrical conductivity. Here, we have studied the effect of pH on the electrochemical over-oxidation process of PEDOT in PEDOT:PSS. High pH is associated with a decrease of over-oxidation potential and an increase of resistivity in the resulting film. Vibrational spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements on over-oxidized PEDOT:PSS films indicate that the decrease in conductivity results from cleavage of the conjugation pathway accompanied by the formation of sulfone, carbonyl and carboxylic groups in the polymer chain.},

This problem can be solved by the introduction of an organic hole-injecting film, poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), between the ITO and the emissive polymer. Indeed, a dramatic improvement of the lifetime and also the luminous efficiency has been observed. However, our Rutherford backscattering(RBS) studies show that the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface is not stable. In as prepared glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS samples 0.02 at. \% indium was found in the PEDOT:PSS film. Annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C during 2500 h increased the indium concentration to 0.2 at. \%. Upon exposure to air much faster degradation of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface was observed; after several days in air the amount of indium reached a saturation concentration of 1.2 at. \%. The degradation of the interface can be explained by etching of the ITO due to the strong acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS.},

The electroluminescence efficiencies of the devices were drastically enhanced by the addition of self-assembled PEDOT layers between the spin-coated PEDOT and ITO. The ITO corrosion by the acidic PEDOT and the migration of the indium components across the interfacial layers were inhibited in the presence of the polyelectrolyte multilayers. Remarkably, the lifetime of the device was 60\% longer than the one without the self-assemblies, which was attributed to the improvement in the interfacial contact.},

Essential synaptic plasticity and learning behaviours were emulated using this memristor, including short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity and spike-rate-dependent plasticity. Important time constants were extracted from these synaptic modifications, which are associated with brain learning and memory functions. It was clearly demonstrated that the movement of the Ag interface upon the initiation of a redox reaction accounts for the resistive switching mechanism of our memristor. The conducting path in the polymer layer and the elastic effect of the polymer matrix were suggested to be considered in the memory and learning processes. Moreover, the energy band diagram of our memristor was drawn after the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images were analysed. It was found that a natural p–n junction in the PEDOT:PSS/Ta compound was formed. This resulted in rectifying, high resistance and low power consumption. Our device structure may be considered a feasible prototype for integrating memristors into a large-scale neuromorphic circuit.},

The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films was enhanced from 0.3 S cm−1 to 1362 S cm−1 after film treatment with methanol. Other alcohols like ethanol and propanol were also used to treat the PEDOT:PSS film and showed inferior conductivity enhancement compared to methanol. The conductivity enhancement was greatly affected by the hydrophilicity and dielectric constant of the alcohols used. The mechanism of conductivity enhancement was investigated through various characterization techniques including FTIR, XPS and AFM. Removal of the insulator PSS from the film, and morphology and conformational changes are the mechanisms for the conductivity enhancement. The treated films also showed high transmittance and low sheet resistance desirable for a standalone electrode. ITO-free polymer solar cells were fabricated using PEDOT:PSS electrodes treated with methanol and showed almost equal performance to ITO electrodes.},

Special attention has been paid to thermal effects and the influence of hydrochloric acid on the chemical and electronic structures of the films, since these issues are important in applications of PEDOT-PSS as a hole-injecting electrode in polymer-based light emitting devices. Three chemically different species were identified in pristine PEDOT-PSS, namely poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid), poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). The HCl-treatment is shown to lead to the conversion of the sodium salt into the free poly(styrenesulfonic acid). Heating of PEDOT-PSS films resulted in a decomposition of the free sulfonic acid component (presumably through loss of SO3), whereas the sodium salt is thermally stable. It is shown that phase segregation occurs in the PEDOT-PSS system resulting in a surface entirely covered by PSS part of the PEDOT-PSS, as indicated by both XPS and UPS measurements.},

	abstract = {The structure of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT · PSS) consists of an insulating PSS layer surrounding doped PEDOT grains. In this study, X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) are used to investigate the composition and electronic structure of as-loaded and lightly sputtered PEDOT · PSS films. The sputtered film shows a significant increase in the PEDOT/PSS ratio (from 0.12 to 0.7) as well as a build-up of the density of filled states close to the Fermi level, consistent with the removal of the insulating PSS layer and the uncovering of the highly doped conducting PEDOT · PSS. The thickness of PSS layer is estimated at 35 ± 5 Å. The elimination of the PSS shell reduces PEDOT · PSS work function to a value equal to that of highly doped PEDOT. The effect of the PSS removal on the charge injection barrier at the interface with the hole-transport material N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (α-NPD) is also investigated. The increase in interface dipole and hole-injection barrier suggests a stronger interaction between the two materials, and points out the key role of the PSS layer in making PEDOT · PSS an effective hole-injection material.},

The self-powered properties were driven by the photovoltaic effect, with a short-circuit current of ∼1.1 nA, an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.2 V and a fill factor of ∼25\%. Furthermore, self-powered properties were also found when the UV irradiated the ZnO tetrapod only, and the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage decreased with the increasing distance between the illuminated spot at the ZnO tetrapod and the heterojunction. The mechanisms for the performances of the detector were examined and discussed. In consideration of the multiterminal feature of ZnO tetrapods, our work provides a possible new approach to developing independent and multifunctional nanodevices.},

	abstract = {Memristive devices have the potential for a complete renewal of the electron devices landscape, including memory, logic, and sensing applications. This is especially true when considering that the memristive functionality is not limited to two-terminal devices, whose practical realization has been demonstrated within a broad range of different technologies. For electron devices, the memristive functionality can be generally attributed to a material state modification, whose dynamics can be engineered to target a specific application. In this review paper, we show that trap charging dynamics can explain some of the memristive effects previously reported for Schottky-barrier field-effect Si nanowire transistors (SB SiNW FETs). Moreover, the SB SiNW FETs do show additional memristive functionality due to trap charging at the metal/semiconductor surface. The combination of these two memristive effects into multiterminal metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices gives rise to new opportunities for both memory and logic applications as well as new sensors based on the physical mechanism that originate memristance. In the special case of four-terminal memristive Si nanowire devices, which are presented for the first time in this paper, enhanced functionality is demonstrated. Finally, the multiterminal memristive devices presented here have the potential of a very high integration density, and they are suitable for hybrid complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cofabrication with a CMOS-compatible process.},

A spectral sensitivity curve is extracted by monitoring the increase in sheet resistance over 500 h while the films are exposed to monochrome light in the spectral range of 290–417 nm at a power level of approximately 2 W/m². It is shown that light of wavelength λ\&lt;315 nm has to be strictly omitted to maintain the film's sheet resistance. The degradation can be significantly slowed down by taking proper encapsulation means. The impact of oxygen and humidity has to be blocked to avoid light induced oxidation reactions of PEDOT and subsequent conductivity losses. Alternatively, the conductivity can be maintained by the addition of stabilizing agents to the polymer dispersion.},

The electrical response of the heterojunctions to triangular voltage pulses in the range between −5 and +5 V is characterized by hysteresis phenomena, observed for hundreds of cycles with low distortions, at scan rates between 1 and 100 mV/s. The hysteresis is ascribed to the occurrence of redox transitions, evidenced by the presence of well-defined peaks in the current–voltage characteristics. The electrical behaviour of the PEDOT:PSS/LiPSSA devices is found to be mainly capacitive, and show humidity-sensitive functionality, demonstrated by the gradual and reversible increase of the area subtended by the J−V cycles as the relative humidity increases.},

The active material comprised a bulk heterojunction formed by poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) sandwiched between a layer of zinc oxide and a layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) that acted as, respectively, electron and hole transporting layers between the active material and the two electrodes indium?tin?oxide (ITO) and printed silver. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in conjunction with isotopic labeling using H218O and 18O2 enabled detailed information on where and to what extent uptake took place. A comparison was made between the use of a humid (oxygen-free) atmosphere and a dry oxygen atmosphere during testing of devices that were kept in the dark and devices that were subjected to illumination under simulated sunlight. It was found that the reactions taking place at the interface between the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS were the major cause of device failure in the case of these inverted devices, which are compatible with full roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and industrial manufacture. The PEDOT:PSS was found to phase separate, with the PEDOT-rich phase being responsible for most of the interface degradation in oxygen atmospheres. In water atmospheres, little chemically induced degradation was observed, whereas a large partially reversible dependence of the open circuit voltage on the relative humidity was observed. In addition, temporal aspects are discussed in regard to degradation mechanisms. Finally, analytical aspects in regard to storing devices are discussed.},

We found that UV irradiated devices show better electrical characteristics and lead to Ohmic contact. The trend in device performance was explained by the observed changes in the work function of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The change in the work function was measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The structural and morphological properties of PEDOT:PSS films with and without UV treatment were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy techniques. The change in the work function of PEDOT:PSS is mainly due to the surface conformational change. The stability of devices with and without UV treatment has been investigated under normal environmental conditions. Electrical properties of the devices have been studied over a period of 30 and 60 days. The stability tests show that devices with UV treatment are more stable that those without UV treatment.},

The solution processed tungsten oxide layer (sWO3) is fully characterized by UV–Vis, XPS, UPS, XRD, AFM, and TEM. Optical transmission of ITO/sWO3 substrates is nearly identical to ITOs. In addition, the sWO3 layer induces nearly ohmic contact to P3HT as PEDOT:PSS layer does, which is determined by UPS measurement. In case that an optimized thickness (∼10 nm) of the sWO3 layer is incorporated in the organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) with a structure of ITO/sWO3/P3HT:PCBM/Al, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 3.4\%, comparable to that of devices utilizing PEDOT:PSS as HEL. Furthermore, the stability of OPV utilizing sWO3 is significantly enhanced due to the air- and photo-stability of the sWO3 layer itself. PCEs are decreased to 40\% and 0\% of initial values, when PEDOT:PSS layers are exposed to air and light for 192 h, respectively. In contrast, PCEs are maintained to 90\% and 87\% of initial PCEs respectively, when sWO3 layers are exposed to the same conditions. Conclusively, we find that solution processed tungsten oxide layers can be prepared easily, act as an efficient hole extraction layer, and afford a much higher stability than PEDOT:PSS layers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth review of the memristor from a rigorous circuit-theoretic perspective, independent of the material the device is made of. From an experimental perspective, a memristor is best defined as any two-terminal device that exhibits a pinched hysteresis loop in the voltage–current plane when driven by any periodic voltage or current signal that elicits a periodic response of the same frequency. This definition greatly broadens the scope of memristive devices to encompass even non-semiconductor devices, both organic and inorganic, from many unrelated disciplines, including biology, botany, brain science, etc. For pedagogical reasons, the broad terrain of memristors is partitioned into three classes of increasing generality, dubbed Ideal Memristors, Generic Memristors, and Extended Memristors. Each class is distinguished from the others via unique fingerprints and signatures. This paper clarifies many confusing issues, such as non-volatility, dc V–I curves, high-frequency v–i curves, local activity, as well as nonlinear dynamical and bifurcation phenomena that are the hallmarks of memristive devices. Above all, this paper addresses several fundamental issues and questions that many memristor researchers do not comprehend but are afraid to ask.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic methods (Raman (514.5 nm excitation), infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) and electrical conductivity measurements were used to characterize the electrically conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) prepared by persulfate oxidation under aqueous conditions. Elemental analysis was carried out on the resulting sulfate-doped PEDOT to determine the sulfate doping level. Due to the difficulty in dedoping highly stable p-doped PEDOT, the sulfate-pre-doped PEDOT was directly treated with iodine solution in order to investigate the secondary doping processes between PEDOT and iodine. Two processes were observed: (1) the further oxidation of the polymer by iodine to produce an increase in the doping level, with triiodide as the dopant and (2) the replacement of sulfate by triiodide in an ion-exchange process involving triiodide in equilibrium with iodine in the iodine solution. Conductivity studies, in conjunction with XPS and EPR experiments, were used to analyse the relationship between the doping level and conductivity that was explained by differences in the nature of SO42− and I3− as dopant ions and a shift in the polaron/bipolaron equilibrium. The Raman spectra (785 nm excitation) of these PEDOT samples were also investigated and a significant change has been observed in the wavenumber of the symmetric Cα = Cβ stretching bands with varying levels of dopants. A correlation was observed between the ratio of the integrated intensities of the symmetric Cα = Cβ stretching bands and the doping level in PEDOT that can be useful for estimating the doping level of a PEDOT sample from its Raman spectrum.},

Room temperature DC conductivity [σDC(RT)] of a free standing film of PEDOT/PSS with H2O was measured to be ∼0.8 S/cm. Through a change of solvents used, σDC(RT) of the samples increases from ∼0.8 to ∼80 S/cm. The temperature dependence of DC conductivity [σDC(T)] of PEDOT/PSS with H2O followed a quasi one-dimensional variable range hopping model, while that of PEDOT/PSS prepared from DMSO, DMF, and THF followed a power law (σDC ∝ Tβ). From X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, the doping concentration of the systems with different solvents was approximately the same.

Different methods of film treatment: immersing PEDOT:PSS film in the methanol solution; dropping methanol on the film; and a combination of these are employed and the results are compared. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films was enhanced from 0.3 S cm−1 to 1362 S cm−1 after film treatment with methanol. Other alcohols like ethanol and propanol were also used to treat the PEDOT:PSS film and showed inferior conductivity enhancement compared to methanol. The conductivity enhancement was greatly affected by the hydrophilicity and dielectric constant of the alcohols used. The mechanism of conductivity enhancement was investigated through various characterization techniques including FTIR, XPS and AFM. Removal of the insulator PSS from the film, and morphology and conformational changes are the mechanisms for the conductivity enhancement. The treated films also showed high transmittance and low sheet resistance desirable for a standalone electrode. ITO-free polymer solar cells were fabricated using PEDOT:PSS electrodes treated with methanol and showed almost equal performance to ITO electrodes.},

The electrical conductivity of PEDOT–PSS/PEG hybrid films was found to be enhanced compared to the PEDOT–PSS pristine film, depending on the PEG concentration and molecular weight. XPS analysis and AFM results showed that PEG induces the phase separation between the PEDOT–PSS conducting particles and the excessive PSSNa shell. Simultaneously PEG may form hydrogen bond with sulfonic groups of PSSH, and hence weaken the electrostatic interactions between PEDOT cationic chains and PSS anionic chains. These resulted in the creation of a better conduction pathway among PEDOT–PSS particles, attributed to the improvement of conductivity.},

The electrical conductivity decreased, as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the PEDOT conductive grains.

Current transients are used to change the fuse from a conducting to a nonconducting state to record a logical “1” or “0”, while the nonlinearity of the OI–HJ allows for passive matrix memory addressing. The device switches at 2 and 4 V for 50 nm thick PEDOT:PSS films on p-type Si and n-type Si, respectively. This is significantly lower than the switching voltage used in PEDOT:PSS/ p-i-n Si memory elements [J. Appl Phys. 94, 7811 (2003)].

The composites of PEDOT with polytetrahydrofuran undergo a structural collapse during electrochemical reduction that requires approximately 800 mV overpotential to re-open and is thus hindering the re-oxidation of the composite. This effect causes the composite at intermediate potentials to be able to have two different oxidation states and thereby resistances, depending on the “on” or “off” switching potential applied prior to the intermediate potential. Notably, this hysteresis is lasting over time and no drift has been observed. Impedance spectroscopy, in-situ UV-Vis spectroscopy, conductivity measurement, in-situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to confirm and explain the switching memory phenomena. The OECT platform was used to validate the PEDOT:PTHF as a one-pot memory source-drain material where a threefold increase in drain current was observed between “off” and “on” mode of the transistor after modulation of the Ag/AgCl gate.},

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies reveal the formation of core?shell type morphology with ferrite particles (60?80 nm) as the center while the polymer (PEDOT) formulates the outer shell of the composite. The presence of barium ferrite nanoparticles in the polymer matrix includes the magnetic losses, which mainly arise from the magnetic hysteresis, domain?wall displacement, and eddy current loss. The higher dielectric (ε?? = 23.5) and magnetic loss (??? = 0.22) contributes to the microwave absorption value of 22.5 dB ({\textgreater}99\% attenuation) and are found to increase with the amount of ferrite constituents.

	abstract = {Conjugated polymers have been used in data-storage devices. A “state” has been written by applying a voltage pulse. The state of the device has been “read” from the current under a small probe voltage (0.2 V). The polymer retained the state for more than 1 h which can be refreshed or erased at will. The stored space charges under a voltage pulse have been found to control the charge injection and hence the device current. Their slow relaxation process has resulted in the use of conjugated polymers in memory device applications. Hysteresis-type behavior has been observed in the current–voltage characteristics. The density of stored charges at the polymer layer near the metal/polymer interface has been found to depend on the voltage amplitude. The relaxation of the stored charges has been studied by applying two voltage pulses. By varying the delay between the two pulses, during which the space charges relax or redistribute, the time constant for charge relaxation has been calculated. The time constant was found to be independent of the density of the space charges or of the pace at which they were stored.},

The authors found that (NH4)2Sx treatment could result in suppressing the hysteresis-type current–voltage characteristics related to the interfacial capacitance variation and a reduction in the equivalent refractive index of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrodes, owing to the improvement in the interfacial stability of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrodes and a reduction in the interface trap-states related charge store at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface.

In particular, regions of grain, matrix, and grain boundary responses are clearly identified. k-Means and Bayesian demixing analysis suggest the characteristic response be separated into four components, with hysteretic-type behavior localized at the BFO–CFO tubular interfaces. The conditions under which Bayesian components allow direct physical interpretation are explored, and transport mechanisms at the grain boundaries and individual phases are analyzed. This approach conjoins multivariate statistical analysis with physics-based interpretation, actualizing a robust, universal, data-driven approach to problem solving, which can be applied to exploration of local transport and other functional phenomena in other spatially inhomogeneous systems.},

	abstract = {Development of new generation electronic devices necessitates understanding and controlling the electronic transport in ferroic, magnetic, and optical materials, which is hampered by two factors. First, the complications of working at the nanoscale, where interfaces, grain boundaries, defects, and so forth, dictate the macroscopic characteristics. Second, the convolution of the response signals stemming from the fact that several physical processes may be activated simultaneously. Here, we present a method of solving these challenges via a combination of atomic force microscopy and data mining analysis techniques. Rational selection of the latter allows application of physical constraints and enables direct interpretation of the statistically significant behaviors in the framework of the chosen physical model, thus distilling physical meaning out of raw data. We demonstrate our approach with an example of deconvolution of complex transport behavior in a bismuth ferrite–cobalt ferrite nanocomposite in ambient and ultrahigh vacuum environments. Measured signal is apportioned into four electronic transport patterns, showing different dependence on partial oxygen and water vapor pressure. These patterns are described in terms of Ohmic conductance and Schottky emission models in the light of surface electrochemistry. Furthermore, deep data analysis allows extraction of local dopant concentrations and barrier heights empowering our understanding of the underlying dynamic mechanisms of resistive switching.},

Largely, this progress was enabled by computer-assisted methods of microscope operation, data acquisition, and analysis. Advances in imaging technology in the beginning of the twenty-first century have opened the proverbial floodgates on the availability of high-veracity information on structure and functionality. From the hardware perspective, high-resolution imaging methods now routinely resolve atomic positions with approximately picometer precision, allowing for quantitative measurements of individual bond lengths and angles. Similarly, functional imaging often leads to multidimensional data sets containing partial or full information on properties of interest, acquired as a function of multiple parameters (time, temperature, or other external stimuli). Here, we review several recent applications of the big and deep data analysis methods to visualize, compress, and translate this multidimensional structural and functional data into physically and chemically relevant information.},

In this paper, we provide a simple mathematical model of Memristors characterized by linear dopant drift for sinusoidal input voltage, showing a high matching with the nonlinear SPICE simulations. The frequency response of the Memristor's resistance and its bounding conditions are derived. The fundamentals of the pinched i-v hysteresis, such as the critical resistances, the hysteresis power and the maximum operating current, are derived for the first time.},

Taking memristive circuit with two memristors for example, dimensionality reduction modeling of the memristive circuit is performed, on which a three-dimensional system model is established. Based on this model, the equilibrium points and stabilities are analyzed, and the dynamical characteristics, when the parameters are varied, are investigated. Furthermore, the analysis results from the conventional model are compared with the results from the dimensionality reduction model of memristive cicuit with two memristors. The results indicate that the dimensionality of the dimensionality reduction model of memristive circuit is related to the number of capacitors and inductors only, but unrelated to the number of memristors; there exist nonlinear phenomena about the coexistence of bifurcation modes in the memristive circuit when circuit parameters are varied; the dimensionality reduction modeling reduces the complexity of system modeling, which is conducive to dynamical charateristic analysis of the system but eliminates the effect of the initial conditions of the memristors internal state variables on dynamical charateristics of memristive circuit.},

The effect of these electrode materials on the performance of ZnO-based memristors has been experimentally studied. Metal/ZnO contact limits the memristor switching mechanism, dominating during the resistive switching. It is observed that the ZnO-based memristor with the Pt electrode shows a better hysteresis compared to Cr and Au metal electrodes. In the case of the Pt electrode, a current ratio of six times in magnitude is observed between the high resistive state and low resistive state at 1 V, where a maximum current density value of 1.25 A/cm(2) is measured. The capacitance of these devices strongly depends on the charge distributed on the surface. Therefore, the capacitance-voltage (C-V) behaviour can be used to understand the charge distribution, under various bias conditions. The C-V behaviour of the Pt memristor, so as to understand the contact interface, where the maximum capacitance of 2.3 x 10(-7) F/cm(2) is obtained at 0 V, is also explained.},

After electroforming, a high resistance state of the Mn:ZnO capacitor revealed switchable diode characteristics whose forward direction was determined by the polarity of the electroforming voltage. Linear fitting of the I-V curves highlighted that the rectifying behavior was influenced by a Schottky barrier at the Pt/Mn:ZnO interface. Our results suggest that formation of conducting filaments from the cathode during the electroforming process resulted in a collapse of the Schottky barrier (near the cathode), and rectifying behaviors dominated by a remnant Schottky barrier near the anode.

	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are currently emerging as powerful tools for biosensing, bioelectronics and nanomedical applications owing to their ability to operate under liquid phase conditions optimally integrating electronic and biological systems. Herein we disclose the unique potential of OECTs for detecting and investigating the electrical properties of insoluble eumelanin biopolymers. Gate current measurements on fine aqueous suspensions of a synthetic eumelanin sample from 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) revealed a well detectable hysteretic response similar to that of the pure monomer in solution, with the formal concentration of the polymer as low as 10−6 M. Induction of the gate current would reflect electron transfer from solid eumelanin to the Pt-electrode sustained by redox active catechol/quinone components of the polymer. A gradual decrease in gate current and areas subtended by hysteretic loops were observed over 5 cycles both in the eumelanin- and DHI-based devices, suggesting evolution of the polymer from a far-from-the-equilibrium redox state toward a more stable electronic arrangement promoted by redox exchange with the gate electrode. OECTs are thus proposed as valuable tools for the efficient heterogeneous-phase sensing of eumelanins and to gauge their peculiar electrical and redox behaviour.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade synthetic melanins, melanin-like polymers and melanin-based copolymers have been the focus of growing attention as soft biocompatible functional materials for engineering high performance, low cost optoelectronic devices, such as memory devices, light emitting diodes and field effect transistors. The unique combination of physicochemical properties of melanins, such as broad band absorption in the UV-visible range, intrinsic free radical character, water-dependent hybrid ionic–electronic conductor behaviour and excellent biocompatibility, have inspired use of melanic polymers as valuable functional materials for organic bioelectronics. However, several gaps and issues still hinder rapid progress of melanin-based organic electronics and bioelectronics, including in particular the limited contribution of electronic conductivity and current decay with time under biasing. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the structural and optoelectronic properties of melanins and to bring to focus current gaps and challenges in the development of melanin-based materials for bioelectronics. Starting from commercial samples, the paper surveys different melanin-type materials with special emphasis on the potential of polydopamine (pDA), a highly adhesive mussel-inspired melanin-type platform, for incorporation in optoelectronic devices. Simple chemical tailoring procedures for engineering pDA-based n-type polymers and photoresponsive materials for photocapacitive sensors are eventually illustrated.},

	abstract = {The electronic structure and optical properties of orthorhombic, monoclinic, and rhombohedral (corundum type) modifications of ZnSiO3, and of rhombohedral, tetragonal, and cubic (spinel type) modifications of Zn2SiO4 have been studied using ab initio density functional theory calculations. The calculated fundamental band gaps for the different polymorphs and compounds are in the range 2.22-4.18 eV. The lowest conduction band is well dispersive similar to that found for transparent conducting oxides such as ZnO. This band is mainly contributed by Zn 4s electrons. The carrier effective masses were calculated and compared with those for ZnO. The topmost valence band is much less dispersive and contributed by O 2p and Zn 3d electrons. From the analysis of charge density, charges residing in each site, and electron localization function, it is found that ionic bonding is mainly ruling in these compounds. The calculated optical dielectric tensors show that the optical properties of ZnSiO3 and Zn2SiO4 are almost isotropic in the visible part of the solar spectra and depend negligibly on the crystal structure. Within the 0-4 eV photon energy range, the calculated magnitude of the absorption coefficient, reflectivity, refractive index, and extinction coefficient are smaller than 10(3) cm(-1), 0.15, 2.2, and 0.3, respectively, for all the ZnSiO3 and Zn2SiO4 phases considered in this work. This suggests that zinc silicates can be used as antireflection coatings.},

To avoid shadowing effects during the coating, the ZnOnanowires were grown with a low area density on a ZnO buffer layer deposited on an a -plane sapphire substrate. By using spatially resolved cathodoluminescence measurements, the luminescence of axial and radial quantum wells were clearly distinguished. The large bandgap energy of the Mg 0.25 Zn 0.75 O barrier material ( ≈ 3.85 eV ) made it possible to tune the energy of quantum wells from 3.4 to 3.7 eV. The homogeneity of the radial quantum well along the wire axis was probed, revealing that only small fluctuations of about 4 meV are found in the main part of the nanowire. Near the tip of the nanowire, the energy of the radial quantum well increases due to locally modified growth conditions reducing the growth rate by up to 15\%. Furthermore, the growth rates of the axial and radial quantum wells were determined, showing that the one in axial direction is a factor of about 2 larger than the one in radial direction.},

This paper presents a novel channel model combining both photon propagation and detection statistics. The channel capacity with binary inputs is numerically computed for on–off keying and 4-pulse-position modulation (4-PPM) at different baud rates. To approach the capacity, error control coding is applied and a message passing decoding technique is outlined. Simulation results for a running example through the paper indicate that, at a given power, there is an optimum transmitted baud rate that maximizes the achievable data rate on such links. With the application of proper coding techniques, it is demonstrated that a near fifty-fold increase in rate over previous reported designs for this channel is feasible.},

In addition, the photodiodes exhibited a low dark current density of 8.2x10(-11) A/cm(2) at a reverse bias of -5 V, which resulted in a large differential resistance. The high quantum efficiency and large differential resistance combine to yield a high detectivity of D*similar to2.0x10(14) cm Hz(1/2) W-1.

Photodetectors based on nanostructures of β-Ga2O3 material usually show a high photoelectric performance. However, low device fabrication repeatability and low effective utilization of light hinder the practical application of the photodetectors. In this work, we propose a preparation method to obtain a Ga2O3 nanowires film which combines the benefits of nanowires and thin films by alternative depositing of Ga2O3 and Al2O3 ultrathin layers. The vertical nanowire structured films are formed at low temperature with an appropriate stress relaxation. Then prototype photodetectors of a metal–semiconductor–metal structure are fabricated using the as-grown films. The nanowire films-based photodetectors exhibit higher responsivities than the smooth film-based photodetector, which is attributed to their larger surface-to-volume ratio and stronger light scattering effects on the nanostructured film surface. Besides, the excellent stability and tolerable response time of Ga2O3/Al2O3 nanowires based photodetectors indicate that the photodetectors can be developed for the future applications in solar-blind ultraviolet communication.},

	abstract = {Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is a general approach to improve the crystallinity of thin solid films. In this study, we investigated the effects of RTA on the structural and electrical properties of Na-doped ZnMgO ﬁlms grown by pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the crystallinity of the Na-doped ZnMgO ﬁlms was improved with RTA at 400–700 °C, and the grain size became larger as the annealing temperature increased. Moreover, room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements demonstrated decent optical quality of the as-deposited and annealed Na-doped ZnMgO ﬁlms. Hall-effect measurements showed that the hole concentration increased from 4.9 × 1014 to 6.6 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.9 × 1017 to 8.3 × 1017 cm−3 while the resistivity and the Hall mobility decreased after the RTA treatments. The conduction type of the films converted from p to n when the annealing temperature is higher than 800 °C. Therefore a wide temperature window to obtain reasonable p-type Na-doped ZnMgO films by RTA is achieved. It is important because RTA is generally needed to obtain p-type Ohmic contact in the fabrication processes of light-emitting diodes (LEDs).},

	abstract = {The ZnO–MgO alloys possess attractive properties for possible applications in optoelectronic and display devices; however, the optical properties are strongly dependent on the deposition parameters. In this work, the effect of the glassy and metallic substrates on the structural, morphological and optical properties of ZnO–MgO thin films using atmospheric pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition was investigated at relatively low deposition temperature, 500 °C. Magnesium and zinc acetylacetonates were used as the metal-organic source. X-ray diffraction experiments provided evidence that the kind of substrates cause a deviation of c-axis lattice constant due to the constitution of a oxide mixture (ZnO and MgO) in combination with different intermetallic compounds(Mg2Zn11 and Mg4Zn7) in the growth films. The substitutional and interstitial sites of Mg2+ instead of Zn2+ ions in the lattice are the most probable mechanism to form intermetallic compounds. The optical parameters as well as thickness of the films were calculated by Spectroscopic Ellipsometry using the classical dispersion model based on the sum of the single and double Lorentz and Drude oscillators in combination with Kato–Adachi equations, as well as X-ray reflectivity.},

High-resolution transmittance electron microscopy showed that the surfacenanowires possessed a flat plateau at the top and a side facet with constant step spacing at the atomic scale. In and ex situ observations of layer growth revealed that anisotropic islands appeared after growing two-dimensional surfaces and that these gradually changed to nanowire structures with increasing layer thickness. Their growth origin, identified from theoretical parameter fittings based on a step-edge barrier model, was close to that of O-polar ZnOgrowth. A large difference in electron transport was clearly observed in Mg 0.12 Zn 0.88 O / ZnO quantum wells(QWs).Transportanisotropy correlated strongly with the surface morphology and with the structural quality of QWs, as confirmed by polarized photoluminescent spectroscopy. Finally, as a possible mechanism of anisotropic electron transport, we suggest that the electron motion perpendicular to the nanowire arrays was strongly restricted due to a potential barrier caused by an interface roughness of the surfacenanowires.},

Evolution of ion-induced damage and structural changes were studied by a combination of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, nuclear reaction analysis and time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis. Results show that damage production enhances in both Zn- and O-sublattices with increasing the Mg content in the MgZnO. However, MgZnO as well as pure ZnO exhibits a high degree of dynamic annealing and MgZnO can not be amorphized even at the highest ion fluence used. Annealing of heavily damaged ZnO leads to a strong surface erosion and thinning of the film. Increasing the Mg content suppresses the surface evaporation in high fluence implanted MgZnO but leads to a strong surface decomposition accompanied with a Mg-rich surface layer formation during post-implantation annealing.},

As the annealing temperature increased, intensity of UV peak decreased while intensity of visible peak (490–520 nm) increased. The structure evolution upon thermal annealing was revealed to be responsible for these abnormal photoluminescence property variations, where unusual ( Zn , Mg ) 1.7 SiO 4 epitaxially evolved on ZnMgO nanowires surface and contributed to the quenching of UV NBE emission. The structure evolution induced UV-NBE quenching and nanoscale localized alloying in semiconductor ZnMgO nanowires could bring up opportunities in catalysis, optoelectronics, spintronics, and sensors.},

The introduction of a ZnO buffer layer enables us to fabricate individual nanowires several micrometres apart (area density{\textless}0.1 nanowire µm−2), suppressing any shadowing effect by neighbouring nanowires during subsequent growth. These low density ZnO nanowires, whose c-axis is perpendicular to the substrate surface, are then used as templates to grow ZnO/ZnMgO core–shell nanowire heterostructures with conventional low-pressure pulsed laser deposition. Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy as well as transmission electron microscopy show that a sharp interface forms between the ZnO core and the ZnMgO shell. Based on these findings, we have grown a series of radial ZnO/ZnMgO quantum wells with different thicknesses that exhibit quantum confinement effects, with thicker quantum wells emitting at lower energies. Spatially resolved cathodoluminescence confirms the homogeneity of the quantum well structure along the full nanowire length of about 3 µm.},

	abstract = {Polycrystalline ZnO thin films were deposited on pure Al foils at 80 °C using electrochemical deposition (ECD) in solutions containing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra between 20 and 200 K showed intense UV emissions near the band edge along with weak broad bands due to defects. When the source solution was slightly doped with Mg2+ ions, the defect-induced band was suppressed along with a redshift, whereas the UV peak position and intensity remained the same. Surprisingly, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) revealed no Mg contents in the films within the detection limit. Based on the solubility products of Mg(OH)2 and Zn(OH)2, we put forward a mechanism to describe how metal impurities could be incorporated into ZnO in such an aqueous process, which was strongly supported by samples grown in Ca- or Cu-doped solutions. To further corroborate, we also fabricated, for the first time via ECD, MgZnO alloys in Mg-doped solutions with very high nitrate concentrations. Blue shift of the UV emission peak was clearly observed from as-prepared samples on Al. MgZnO films, deposited on Si substrates under similar supersaturated conditions and annealed in ambient air at 350 °C for 30 min, showed a similar peak shift. This electrochemical route could therefore be used as an effective approach to enhance the optical properties of compound semiconductors, demonstrating its potential for deep UV applications as well.},

	abstract = {The practice of semiconducting nanowires in the photoelectronic nano-devices requires that the band gaps of the nanowires are controllable in the process of the synthesis, where the bandgap of a semiconducting nanowire is highly dependent on its chemical components and the structural parameters. In this work, by performing theoretical calculations at the level of the density functional theory, the band gaps of the Mg x Zn 1 - x O nanowires with different contents of Mg and different structural features are extensively studied. Through correlating the calculated band gaps to both the contents of Mg and the structural parameters, we find that the bandgap of a Mg x Zn 1 - x O nanowire can be expressed by an empirical formula. Our calculations indicate that this formula is valid for the ZnOnanowires, the alloy MgZnO nanowires, as well as the ZnO / Mg x Zn 1 - x O core-shell nanowires. We anticipate that this empirical formula can serve as a guidance for designing a MgZnO nanowire with the desired bandgap in its realistic applications.},

We demonstrate that such efficiencies can be attained through the use of ZnO/Zn(1−x)MgxO core–shell quantum well heterostructures grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. Varying the barrier Mg concentration from x = 0.15 to 0.3 leads to the formation of misfit induced dislocations in the multi-quantum wells. Correlatively, temperature dependent photoluminescence reveals that the radial well luminescence intensity decreases much less rapidly with increasing temperature for the lower Mg concentration. Indeed, about 54\% of the 10 K intensity is retained at room temperature with x = 0.15, against 1\% with x = 0.30. These results open the way to the realization of high optical efficiency nanowire-based light-emitting diodes.},

To avoid shadowing effects during the coating, the ZnOnanowires were grown with a low area density on a ZnO buffer layer deposited on an a -plane sapphire substrate. By using spatially resolved cathodoluminescence measurements, the luminescence of axial and radial quantum wells were clearly distinguished. The large bandgap energy of the Mg 0.25 Zn 0.75 O barrier material ( ≈ 3.85 eV ) made it possible to tune the energy of quantum wells from 3.4 to 3.7 eV. The homogeneity of the radial quantum well along the wire axis was probed, revealing that only small fluctuations of about 4 meV are found in the main part of the nanowire. Near the tip of the nanowire, the energy of the radial quantum well increases due to locally modified growth conditions reducing the growth rate by up to 15\%. Furthermore, the growth rates of the axial and radial quantum wells were determined, showing that the one in axial direction is a factor of about 2 larger than the one in radial direction.},

	abstract = {Nitrides, such as magnesium silicon nitride, hold promise for applications requiring materials with high thermal conductivity. The synthesis of the ternary nitride MgSiN2 is accomplished using SiO2 and Mg3N2 as reactants in a solid-state metathesis (exchange) reaction. This self-propagating reaction is readily initiated when a flame with a temperature ≥1100 °C is brought into contact with a pressed SiO2/Mg3N2 pellet. By using Mg3N2 in ≥1 M excess, X-ray-pure MgSiN2 can be produced. With lower ratios, elemental silicon forms as an impurity. Increasing the flame initiation temperature to ≥2500 °C can also be used to eliminate silicon impurities with the benefit of increasing the crystallinity of the product. The use of other forms of silica as a silicon source provides an inexpensive alternative to produce MgSiN2. A variety of silica sources are examined, including fumed silica, sand, ground quartz, bottle glass, and rice hull ash. Since rice hull ash is an industrial waste product from rice processing, new applications such as in the synthesis of MgSiN2 could prove to be environmentally friendly.},

The resonant conditions provided by excitation with different ultraviolet laser lines enabled the detection of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons from domains with the wurtzite structure, and domains with the cubic rocksalt structure which lack inversion symmetry due to alloying. The phonon behavior was modeled in terms of three- and four-phonon decay processes using Ridley and Klemens type decay processes. It is found that the wurtzite phase displays dominantly three-phonon decay with a small four-phonon component. In contrast, the cubic phase displays a higher degree of anharmonicity in which the four-phonon processes contribute significantly to the temperature dependent frequency shift. At the elevated temperature range, the LO frequency shift rate is ∼−2.6 × 10−2 cm−1/K for the wurtzite structure while that of the cubic exhibits a much larger shift rate of ∼−1.6 × 10−1 cm−1/K. The larger anharmonicity of the domains with the cubic structure is discussed in terms of strain and deformation effects.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors present research on the low temperature resonant Raman scattering of the LO modes of Mg 0.2 Zn 0.8 O nanocrystals. They found that in the LO spectral range, two coupled modes appear: the main LO mode of the alloy and a low frequency mode redshifted by ∼ 27 cm − 1 relative to the main one. The low frequency mode was analyzed in terms of three mechanisms applicable to Raman scattering of an alloy system that might result in its activation: phase segregation due to the low solubility limit of the MgO–ZnO alloy system, a convolution of the A 1 ( LO ) with the E 1 ( LO ) mode, and an order-disorder state. Their analyses indicate that the principle mechanism that activates the low frequency mode is scattering due to the disordered state of the nanoalloys.},

Microstructural analysis carried out by TEM reveals formation of thin oxide layer with increased layer thickness on growth temperature, in the interface between Si substrate and MgZnO thin film. Irrespective of growth temperature, increase in Mg mole fraction with increase in thickness of MgZnO thin film is observed from EDX and AES spectroscopy, and a maximum of 14 at. \% Mg is observed at 800 °C. The photoluminescence investigation shows blue shift of 104 meV in MgZnO film grown at 800 °C, compared to the film grown at 600 °C, which is due to the enhancement of the Mg incorporation at higher temperature. In addition, annealing at the growth temperature enhanced the intensity ratio of the UV/deep level emission and increased the grain size. Thermal treatment in a vacuum improved the emission efficiency and changed the origin of the point defects.},

However, the quaternary system BeMgZnO is predicted to be stable with small Be/Mg atom ratio. Subsequently, a wurtzite Be0.17Mg0.54Zn0.29O alloy with a bandgap of 5.15 eV has been acquired experimentally. Its bandgap is in the middle of solar blind region and thus it is an ideal material for realizing a high rejection ratio solar blind ultraviolet (UV) detector, which has long been a problem. A metal?semiconductor?metal (MSM) structured solar blind UV detector based on this material is then fabricated, realizing a much higher rejection ratio than reported MgZnO-based detectors. One more interesting thing is, as a complicated quaternary system, BeMgZnO can maintain its crystal quality in a wide compositional range, which is not happening in MgZnO and BeZnO. To get some microscopic insight into the Be?Mg mutual stabilizing mechanism, more calculations on the lattice constants of BeZnO and MgZnO alloys, and the coordination preference of Be ions in alloy were conducted. The a-axis lattice compensation and 4-fold coordination preference of Be atom are confirmed the major origins for Be?Mg mutual stabilizing in ZnO lattice.},

Both room temperature and low temperature (40 K) photoluminescence results revealed an enhanced and blue-shifted near-band-edge (NBE) ultraviolet (UV) emission for the MgO/ZnO nanowires compared to those of the pure ZnO nanowire arrays, indicating the success of Mg alloying into ZnO nanowires. This enhancement might be due to the 155 °C hydrothermal process and the amorphous MgO layer in the MgO/ZnO nanowires. The specific template of densely packed ZnO nanowire arrays was suggested to be instrumental in enabling this type of MgO/ZnO composite nanowire growth.},

	abstract = {In this paper, MgZnO films were annealed at various temperatures (700–900 °C) and their effects on the electrical characteristics of Schottky-barrier photodetectors (SB-PDs) were studied. We show that the content of Mg atom increases with annealing temperature. On 900 °C annealing, the Mg content is determined to be as high as 49.2 at. \%. However, no cubic-phase MgZnO segregation occurs in such high-temperature annealed MgZnO films, revealing the MgZnO film grown by radio-frequency sputtering is rather stable. Moreover, high-temperature (900 °C) annealing results in denser MgZnO film and smaller gap between the grains, leading to higher mobility and lower sheet resistance compared with low-temperature annealed MgZnO films. The enhanced performance results in the 900 °C annealed SB-PD exhibiting higher rectification ratio of 326 compared to the 800 °C annealed SB-PD that has a rectification ratio only 40. Further, lower sheet resistance reduces the turn-on voltage from {\textgreater}200 V (for SB-PD with as-deposited MgZnO film) to 0.4 V (for SB-PD with 900°C annealed MgZnO film). Even at low (−10 V) bias-voltage, the 900 °C annealed SB-PD presents the highest ultraviolet (UV) responsivity (0.088 A/W) and UV-visible rejection ratio (2264) compared with the SB-PDs with low-temperature annealed MgZnO films at very high (−100 V) bias-voltage.},

This paper presents a type of new inorganic nanopeapod: faceted Au nanoparticles inside MgO nanowires. The Au self-assembles into a nanoparticle chain during the vapor–liquid–solid growth of the MgO nanowires for which gold also serves as the catalyst. Surprisingly such a chain can follow the whole axis of the MgO nanowires even if the latter zigzag, provided that the amount of gold is sufficient. It is shown that such Au@MgO nanopeapods form not only under metalorganic chemical vapor deposition conditions (Lai et al 2009 Appl. Phys. Lett. 94 022904), but also under our conventional vapor transport deposition condition. This new nanopeapod material might be a candidate for the study of electronic and/or plasmonic wave transport along nanowires.},

In both as-grown and annealed structures, microcathodoluminescence spectra in the near-bandgap region demonstrate a blue-shift by 0.13 eV compared with bulk ZnO films, indicating carrier confinement in the MgZnO/ZnO/MgZnO quantum well (QW). Annealing strongly decreases the concentration of shallow uncompensated donors from {\textasciitilde}1017 cm−3 to {\textasciitilde}1016 cm−3 and makes it possible to probe the region of the QW by capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling. This profiling confirms charge accumulation in the QW. The dominant electron traps in the as-grown films are the well-known traps with activation energies of 0.3 eV and 0.8 eV. After annealing, the electron traps observed in the structure have activation energies of 0.14 eV, 0.33 eV, and 0.57 eV, with the Fermi level in the n-ZnO(P) pinned by the 0.14-eV traps. The annealing also introduces deep compensating defects that decrease the intensity of band-edge luminescence and produce a deep luminescence defect band at 2.2 eV. In addition, a defect vibrational band becomes visible in Raman spectra near 650 cm−1. No conversion to p-type conductivity was detected. The results are compared with the data for the structures successfully converted to p-type, and possible reasons for the observed differences are discussed.},

	abstract = {p-type nitrogen doped Zn1−xMgxO (x = 0.15) thin films were prepared on n-type silicon substrates by RF sputtering. Plasma-immersion-ion technique and rapid-thermal process were used to implant nitrogen and annealing (700–1000 °C) of these films respectively. Annealed samples at 700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C showed effective improvement of the structural and optical properties. X-ray diffraction spectra showed improvement in {\textless}002{\textgreater} orientation of films with increase in annealing temperatures. In Raman spectra, the peak at 436 cm−1 corresponds to E 2 high phonons mode of ZnMgO wurtzite structure and FWHM of this peak decreases with increase in annealing temperature, indicating improvement in crystalline quality. The scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate that nitrogen-implanted ZnMgO film annealed at 1000 °C has better morphology in comparison to other films. Low-temperature (15 K) photoluminescence measurements revealed acceptor-bound exciton peak at 3.45 eV and donor-bound exciton peak around 3.52 eV. Increased intensity of acceptor-bound exciton peak with increasing annealing temperature proves that nitrogen implantation and subsequent annealing increase the acceptor concentration in the film, indicating tendency for p-type conduction at higher annealing temperature. The film annealed at 1000 °C was observed to produce only acceptor-bound exciton emission and no donor-bound exciton emission was occurred. Hall-effect measurements showed p-type conductivity for annealed films in temperature range at 800–1000 °C. The acceptor level at 3.45 eV in PL spectra is responsible for this p-type conduction in these films. The highest hole concentration of 1.91 × 1015 cm−3 has been achieved for film annealed at 1000 °C.},

	abstract = {Cubic crystalline MgZnO was grown on p-type Si (0 0 1) by a reactive e-beam evaporation system at low temperature. AES depth profiles for the MgZnO films demonstrate good uniformity of Mg, Zn and O components. MIS capacitors were fabricated and C – V and I – V characterizations were performed to evaluate the annealing effect on electrical properties of MgZnO films. High temperature annealing up to 900 °C under O 2 ambient significantly improves C – V and I – V characteristics. The interface trapped charges decrease from 5.30 × 10 12 cm −2 to 2.48 × 10 11 cm −2 as the annealing temperature increases from 550 °C to 900 °C, indicating the quality improvement of the interfacial layer. Meanwhile the density of mobile charges increases from 1.93 × 10 10 cm −2 to 1.72 × 10 11 cm −2 as the annealing temperature increases from 550 °C to 900 °C, which is attributed to the evaporation of O near the surface and migration of Zn 2+ towards the surface from MgZnO alloy film under such high temperatures.},

The absorption edges of MgxZn1 − xO films can cover the whole near ultraviolet and even the whole solar-blind spectra range, and the solar-blind wurtzite/cubic MgxZn1 − xO films have been realized successfully by the same method. In addition, the absorption edges of annealed films shift to a long wavelength, which is caused by the diffusion of Zn atoms gathering at the surface during the thermal treatment process. Finally, the truly solar-blind metal-semiconductor-metal structured photodetectors based on wurtzite Mg0.445Zn0.555O and cubic Mg0.728Zn0.272O films were fabricated.

High-density (similar to 10 mu m(-2)) nanowire arrays can be grown on sapphire substrates with or without gold catalysts. However, if a ZnO wetting layer was adopted, the density of ZnO nanowires could be controlled with high reproducibility. The decreasing growth density is attributed to a competition between the two-dimensional film epitaxy and one-dimensional nanowire growth. The dependence of nanowire density on the substrate-target distance mainly arises from the expansion dynamics of the plasma plume and the chamber geometry. Using low-density nanowires as templates, a general PLD route was developed to grow radial nanowire heterostructures. Here we demonstrate MgZnO/ZnO/MgZnO nanowire quantum wells and ZnO/ZnO:P core-shell nanowire p-n junctions.},

	abstract = {Electromechanical phenomena in semiconductors are still poorly studied from a fundamental and an applied science perspective, even though significant strides have been made in the last decade or so. Indeed, most current electromechanical devices are based on ferroelectric oxides. Yet, the importance of the effect in certain semiconductors is being increasingly recognized. For instance, the magnitude of the electric field in an AlN/GaN nanostructure can reach 1–10 MV/cm. In fact, the basic functioning of an (0001) AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor is due to the two-dimensional electron gas formed at the material interface by the polarization fields. The goal of this review is to inform the reader of some of the recent developments in the field for nanostructures and to point out still open questions. Examples of recent work that involves the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects in semiconductors include: the study of the optoelectronic properties of III-nitrides quantum wells and dots, the current controversy regarding the importance of the nonlinear piezoelectric effect, energy harvesting using ZnO nanowires as a piezoelectric nanogenerator, the use of piezoelectric materials in surface acoustic wave devices, and the appropriateness of various models for analyzing electromechanical effects. Piezoelectric materials such as GaN and ZnO are gaining more and more importance for energy-related applications; examples include high-brightness light-emitting diodes for white lighting, high-electron mobility transistors, and nanogenerators. Indeed, it remains to be demonstrated whether these materials could be the ideal multifunctional materials. The solutions to these and other related problems will not only lead to a better understanding of the basic physics of these materials, but will validate new characterization tools, and advance the development of new and better devices. We will restrict ourselves to nanostructures in the current article even though the measurements and calculations of the bulk electromechanical coefficients remain challenging. Much of the literature has focused on InGaN/GaN, AlGaN/GaN, ZnMgO/ZnO, and ZnCdO/ZnO quantum wells, and InAs/GaAs and AlGaN/AlN quantum dots for their optoelectronic properties; and work on the bending of nanowires have been mostly for GaN and ZnO nanowires. We hope the present review article will stimulate further research into the field of electromechanical phenomena and help in the development of applications.},

Magnesium doped zinc oxide thin films (Zn0.85Mg0.15O) were deposited by sol–gel route on p-type silicon and annealed at different temperatures in oxygen environment for an hour. The doping of magnesium in zinc oxide was confirmed by X-Ray diffraction and the samples were found to have wurtzite crystal structure with (002) preferred orientation. The films were characterized by Hall-effect, atomic force microscopy, UV–VIS spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and work function measurements. The different studies exhibited an anomalous behavior for the film annealed at 900 °C. The Hall effect, work function measurements and UV–VIS spectroscopy indicated that the resistivity, work function and optical band gap increased as a function of annealing temperature (from 300 °C to 700 °C) however these parameters were found to decrease for the films annealed above 700 °C. The particle size increased with the annealing but for the samples annealed at 900 °C, the shape of the grains changed and became elongated like fibers as observed by the atomic force microscopy. The PL measurements displayed the existence of oxygen vacancies defects for the samples annealed at and above 600 °C. The possible mechanism for this anomaly has been discussed in this work.},

Hall-effect measurements show that annealing temperature has great effect on the electrical property of both ZnO and MgZnO films. The electron concentration of both ZnO and MgZnO films increases with annealing temperature ranging from 200 °C to 400 °C, and then decreases, which is attributed to incorporation of H into ZnO as a shallower donor during the annealing process and change of solid solubility of hydrogen in ZnO and MgZnO films with annealing temperature. The D0X emission is related to the hydrogen in MgZnO film and the donor level of the H is estimated to be 33.5 meV. It is also found that the controversial luminescence band at 3.310 eV can be formed in un-doped ZnO film upon annealing and its intensity increases with increasing annealing temperature, implying that this band may be not related to p-type doping.},

Here, we propose a rapid and highly efficient ZnMgO NC alloying method based on pulsed laser ablation in liquid. The limit value of homogeneous magnesium (Mg) is pushed from 37\% to 62\%, and the optical band gap is increased to 3.7 eV with high doping efficiency ({\textgreater} 100\%). Further investigations on the lattice geometry of ZnMgO NCs indicate that all ZnMgO NCs are hexagonal wurtzite structures, and the (002) and (100) peaks shift to higher diffraction angles with the increase in Mg doping content. The calculated results of the lattice constants a and c slightly decrease based on Bragg's law and lattice geometry equations. Furthermore, the relationship between annealing temperature and the limit value of homogeneous Mg is examined, and the results reveal that the latter decreases with the former because of the phase separation of MgO. A probable mechanism of zinc magnesium alloy is introduced to expound on the details of the laser-alloying process.},

ZnO nanowire arrays, prepared by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), were used as seed layers for ZnMgO nanowires. For the fabrication of ZnMgO nanowires, RF powers and sputtering pressure were varied to control the supersaturation condition and the kinetic energies of the sputtered materials. Vertically aligned ZnMgO nanowires with [0 0 0 1] preferred orientation were obtained at a working pressure of 20 × 10−3 Torr, RF power of 50 W and 15 W for ZnO and Mg targets, respectively. Crystallinity of the nanostructures were improved with rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 900 °C. Furthermore, the blue shift in the near-band-edge emission of RTA-treated ZnMgO nanowires was observed during photoluminescence study.},

In this work, by performing theoretical calculations at the level of the density functional theory, the band gaps of the Mg x Zn 1 - x O nanowires with different contents of Mg and different structural features are extensively studied. Through correlating the calculated band gaps to both the contents of Mg and the structural parameters, we find that the bandgap of a Mg x Zn 1 - x O nanowire can be expressed by an empirical formula. Our calculations indicate that this formula is valid for the ZnOnanowires, the alloy MgZnO nanowires, as well as the ZnO / Mg x Zn 1 - x O core-shell nanowires. We anticipate that this empirical formula can serve as a guidance for designing a MgZnO nanowire with the desired bandgap in its realistic applications.},

	abstract = {Polycrystalline ZnO thin films were deposited on pure Al foils at 80 °C using electrochemical deposition (ECD) in solutions containing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra between 20 and 200 K showed intense UV emissions near the band edge along with weak broad bands due to defects. When the source solution was slightly doped with Mg2+ ions, the defect-induced band was suppressed along with a redshift, whereas the UV peak position and intensity remained the same. Surprisingly, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) revealed no Mg contents in the films within the detection limit. Based on the solubility products of Mg(OH)2 and Zn(OH)2, we put forward a mechanism to describe how metal impurities could be incorporated into ZnO in such an aqueous process, which was strongly supported by samples grown in Ca- or Cu-doped solutions. To further corroborate, we also fabricated, for the first time via ECD, MgZnO alloys in Mg-doped solutions with very high nitrate concentrations. Blue shift of the UV emission peak was clearly observed from as-prepared samples on Al. MgZnO films, deposited on Si substrates under similar supersaturated conditions and annealed in ambient air at 350 °C for 30 min, showed a similar peak shift. This electrochemical route could therefore be used as an effective approach to enhance the optical properties of compound semiconductors, demonstrating its potential for deep UV applications as well.},

The highly reactive N 2 plasma generated by APPJ allows much shorter treatment time compared with conventional thermal anneals. The APPJ treatment can increase the crystallinity of ZnO films and release the compressive residue stresses, verified by XRD and UV–Vis transmission measurements. In our previous studies, we demonstrate that thermal anneal is the critical step for the formation of two-dimensional electron gases in defective rf-sputtered MgZnO/ZnO heterostructures. This paper reports the experimental results that APPJ treatments can be used for the same purpose with a much shorter processing time. A thirty-second APPJ anneal on ZnO can be used to replace 400 °C × 30 min furnace-anneal to promote the formation of 2DEGs in MgZnO/ZnO heterostructure. The ultra-short processing time is attributed to the synergy of plasma reactivity and temperature of APPJ.},

In this study, the films were analyzed using Hall measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transparent performance measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD results showed two peaks: MgO2 (002)-wurtzite and MgxZn1−xO (111)-cubic peaks. The Nb-MZO films exhibited high transparency, with transmittance exceeding 90\% in the visible region and a sharp absorption edge in the ultraviolet (UV) region, implying that the MgO content in the Nb-MZO layer increased the bandgaps. These results indicate that Nb-MZO films are ideal for use as transparent contact layers in near-UV light-emitting diodes. Hall measurements and XPS results successfully demonstrated the p-type conductivity of the Nb-MZO films because of the composition of the N-Nb binding caused by annealing in nitrogen atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The Mgx Zn 1−xO alloy system is emerging as an environmentally friendly choice in ultraviolet lighting and sensor technologies. Knowledge of defects which impact their optical and material properties is a key issue for utilization of these alloys in various technologies. The impact of phase segregation, structural imperfections, and alloy inhomogeneities on the phonon dynamics and electronic states of Mgx Zn 1−xO thin films were studied via selective resonant Raman scattering (SRRS) and Urbach analyses, respectively. A series of samples with Mg composition from 0–68\% were grown using a sputtering technique, and the optical gaps were found to span a wide UV range of 3.2–5.8 eV. The extent of the inherent phase segregation was determined via SRRS using two UV-laser lines to achieve resonance with the differing optical gaps of the embedded cubic and wurtzite structural domains. The occurrence of Raman scattering from cubic structures is discussed in terms of relaxation of the selection rules due to symmetry breaking by atomic substitutions. The Raman linewidth and Urbach energy behavior indicate the phase segregation region occurs in the range of 47–66\% Mg. Below the phase segregation, the longitudinal optical phonons are found to follow the model of one-mode behavior. The phonon decay model of Balkanski et al. indicates that the major contributor to Raman linewidth arises from the temperature-independent term attributed to structural defects and alloy inhomogeneity, while the contribution from anharmonic decay is relatively small. Moreover, a good correlation between Urbach energy and Raman linewidth was found, implying that the underlying crystal dynamics affecting the phonons also affect the electronic states. Furthermore, for alloys with low Mg composition structural defects are dominant in determining the alloy properties, while at higher compositions alloy inhomogeneity cannot be neglected.},

Compared with the experimental data of symmetric and asymmetric MSM structures based on ZnO substrate, the validity of this model is verified. The asymmetric Schottky barrier and electrode area devices exhibit reductions of 20 times and 1.3 times on dark current, respectively, without apparent photocurrent scarification. The plots of photo-to-dark current ratio (PDR) indicate that the asymmetric MgZnO MSM structure has better dark current characteristic than that of the symmetric one.},

The influence of Mg diffusion and material homogenization is evaluated through absorption, PL, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. No appreciable change in the spectral positions is seen either in PL or absorption up to an annealing temperature of 700 °C, which is also supported by SIMS. However at higher annealing temperatures, diffusion of Mg into the ZnO layer is clearly evident in SIMS profile, which results in the red-shift (blue-shift) of spectral positions of MgZnO (ZnO) layer, respectively. Finally, for the sample annealed at 900 °C, the two layers are completely merged providing a single peak at ∼3.60 eV in PL/absorption corresponding to a completely homogenized MgZnO layer. Spectroscopic results are corroborated by the numerical simulations based on a simple theoretical model, which correlates the observed PL spectra of the heterostructures with the experimental Mg diffusion profiles across the heterointerface, as measured by SIMS.},

Well-defined core/shell heterostructures with high-quality interfaces and coherent epitaxial relationship were confirmed by Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and line-scan compositional analyses. It is interesting to note that the MgZnO shell thickness gradually decreases from the tip to the base of the nanorods, due to a shadow effect during the deposition. The nonuniform coating allows us to study the carrier confinement and surface passivation effects on a single nanorod. Spatially resolved cathodoluminescence measurements reveal that the band-edge emission intensity of ZnO cores is variable along their length, and depends strongly on the shell thickness. A model, which involves carrier tunneling, surface trapping, and radiative/nonradiative recombination processes, was developed to understand this phenomenon. However, a high-temperature thermal treatment may lead to the stress relaxation and the formation of interfacial defects, and enhance the interdiffusion of interfacial atoms. These degrade the optical quality of coaxial nanorods.},

And because the solid solubility of Zn atoms in cubic MgZnO increased with temperature, the cubic ZnO didn't form in MgZnO thin films deposited at higher temperature.

	abstract = {Using resonant Raman spectroscopy, the authors report on the alloying effect and localization of electronic states in Zn1−xMgxOZn1−xMgxO Anomalous intensity enhancement of the second-order longitudinal optical phonon has been observed, which is due to Fröhlich interaction via the localized exciton as the resonant intermediate electronic states. The alloying-induced disorder due to Mg incorporation led to the enhancement of exciton localization as well as the asymmetric broadening of longitudinal optical phonon line shape. The composition in ZnMgO could be determined by the first-order longitudinal optical phonon frequency via a bowinglike quadratic fit. This simple relationship is in perfect match to the modified random-element-isodisplacement model and provides a nondestructive approach to probe the quantitative composition distributions in wurtzite ZnMgO alloy system.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable improvements within the last decades, electrochromic (EC) window coatings are still too expensive to be applied in buildings on a large scale. Beside the manufacturing costs, wiring costs have to be added which may exceed the fabrication expenses of the electrochromic window. Therefore, self-powered electrochromic windows have been considered, where a semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) cell provides the power to activate an electrochromic system deposited on top of the solar cell. The whole PVEC device consists of up to eight layers which must be deposited on large scales without short circuits or other failures. Recently, we came up with a much simpler idea where power generation and electrochromic properties are combined rather than just added as in the case of the PVEC cell. The whole device now is obtained by the deposition of only three layers and is highly transparent in the bleached state. Exposing it to sunlight and completing an external circuit the device can be colored within a few minutes, reducing the transmission by about 40\%. Bleaching occurs either spontaneously by blocking the sunlight or is induced by a small rechargeable battery which can be incorporated in the external circuit and is charged from the device when exposed to sunlight.},

In particular, multi-layered nanostructured films play an important role as a part of the energy system for energy saving applications in buildings. Inkjet printing is a low-cost and attractive technology for patterning and deposition of multi-layered nanostructured materials on various substrates. However, it requires the development of a suitable ink formulation with optimum viscosity, surface tension and evaporation rate for various materials. In this study, a versatile ink formulation was successfully developed to prepare NiO and WO3 nanostructured films with strong adhesion to ITO coated glass using inkjet printing for energy saving electrochromic applications. We achieved a high performance electrochromic electrode, producing porous and continuous electrochromic films without aggregation. The NiO film with 9 printed layers exhibits an optical modulation of 64.2\% at 550 nm and a coloration efficiency (CE) of 136.7 cm2 C−1. An inkjet-printed complementary all solid-state device was assembled, delivering a larger optical modulation of 75.4\% at 633 nm and a higher CE of 131.9 cm2 C−1 among all solid-state devices. The enhanced contrast is due to the printed NiO film that not only performs as an ion storage layer, but also as a complementary electrochromic layer.},

The device is based on a three electrode system comprising an electrochromic electrode, a battery anode and a battery cathode, all in contact with a common electrolyte. The electrochromic electrode can be charged and discharged directly when connected to either the anode or cathode. Such a self-powered display integrates the functions of both a display and a battery. As part of a flexible electronics device, a self-powered display would be able to power other components, such as driver electronics.},

Study of the relation between open-circuit voltage and the energy levels of the donor/acceptor(2) in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells has stimulated interest in modifying the open-circuit voltage by tuning the energy levels of polymers(3). Here, we show that the open-circuit voltage of polymer solar cells constructed based on the structure of a low-bandgap polymer, PBDTTT(4), can be tuned, step by step, using different functional groups, to achieve values as high as 0.76 V. This increased open-circuit voltage combined with a high short-circuit current density results in a polymer solar cell with a power conversion efficiency as high as 6.77\%, as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.},

Sequential layer growth was achieved by the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of biocompatible polyelectrolytes (PEs). The coated colloids were characterized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vitro release of Avermectin from microcapsules was studied under the simulated insect midgut conditions. W-doped TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method, and characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements and SEM. The photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts, which were undoped with TiO2 and W-doped TiO2, were evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation degradation of AVM microcapsules in aqueous solution under UV illumination. The toxicity of the photodegradable insecticide was evaluated by the adult stage Martianus dermestoides. The results showed that AVM microcrystals which were obtained by association had a mean length of 13.8 μm and a zeta potential of −34.7 mV. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 65.57 ± 0.96\% and 46.15 ± 0.96\%, respectively. The in vitro release experiments revealed that the polyelectrolytes prolonged the release time of the encapsulated AVM microcrystals. The sample which was prepared at 120 °C with 4.0 mol\% W-doped amount had the highest photocatalytic activity.

	abstract = {An innovative concept of solution type photovoltaic electrochromic (PV-EC) device has been developed. The device includes a semi-transparent silicon thin-film solar cell (Si-TFSC) substrate, an electrochromic solution, and a transparent non-conductive substrate, wherein the electrochromic solution is located between the transparent non-conductive substrate and the Si-TFSC substrate. The solution type PV-EC device has at least the following advantages: (1) the electrodes in the PV-EC device are planarly distributed in the whole semi-transparent Si-TFSC substrate to create a uniform electric field, which makes large area PV-EC module application feasible; (2) since the PV-EC device can be driven with low voltage and low current, the demand for photopotential and photocurrent produced by the Si-TFSCs is lowered and thus the thickness of an intrinsic layer in each of the Si-TFSCs can be thinned, which increases the transmittance of the device, and (3) the electrical power generated by the PV-EC module can be controlled by an additional output switch layout coupled with the Si-TFSC. When illuminated by sunlight, a portion of electronic current produced by a Si-TFSC is converted into ionic current to cause color changing of the PV-EC device, while the monolithically integrated Si-TFSC module generates electricity to a connected load. In view of photoelectric conversion and optical modulation properties, the PV-EC device can both function as solar cell module and as self-powered smart glass, which has great advantages in green energy application.},

	abstract = {Tungsten oxide nanoparticles were synthesized via a sol?gel route using metallic tungsten as precursor, and were printed on a flexible electrode using inkjet printing in order to build solid-state electrochromic cells. Several spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize and compare tungsten oxide particles obtained from different origins. FTIR, Raman and X-ray diffraction spectroscopic measurements showed that the sol?gel synthesis described here produces nanoparticles mainly in an amorphous state with hexagonal crystalline domains and allowed the analysis of the hydration extent of those nanoparticles. The size was measured combining dynamic light scattering, sedimentation, and microscopic techniques (AFM), showing a consistent size of about 200 nm. The tungsten oxide nanoparticles were used to produce an ink formulation for application in inkjet printing. Solid-state electrochromic devices were assembled at room temperature, without sintering the tungsten oxide printed films, showing excellent contrast between on/off states. Electrochemical characterization of those films is described using cyclic voltammetry. The devices were then tested through spectroelectrochemistry by Visible/NIR absorption spectroscopy (400?2200 nm range), showing a dual spectroscopic response depending on the applied voltage. This phenomenon is attributed to the presence of two different crystalline states in accordance with results obtained from the spectroscopic characterization of the nanoparticles. The electrochromic cells had a good cycling stability showing high reversibility and a cyclability up to more than 50?000 cycles with a degradation of 25\%.},

W/Ti atomic ratio was determined by Rutherford back scattering (RBS) analysis. The electrical response towards ethanol and methanol (100–500 ppm) have been tested in the temperature range of 300–500 °C. Doping effects on structural and sensing properties were investigated.

	abstract = {WO3 thin layers with nanometer-scale periodicity were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) using a novel amphiphilic block-copolymer template (poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)). The evolution of the mesoporous ordered network and the crystallinity of the framework were monitored by 2D-SAXS, WAXS, SEM, XPS, and porosimetry. By annealing the films, the pore-wall crystallinity is adjusted between fully amorphous and highly crystalline without mesostructural degradation. Thus, the crystalline-film framework is composed of phase-pure monoclinic WO3 nanoparticles (12–14 nm in size). Furthermore, heat treatment transforms the originally spherical mesopores into ellipsoids, resulting in a unidirectionally shrunken, but still well-defined and fully accessible bcc mesopore architecture. The influence of mesoporosity and crystallinity on electrochemical/electrochromic characteristics was addressed by monitoring electrochemical features and the absorption changes during Li insertion/extraction (repetitive potentiostatic cycling). Both the amorphous and crystalline mesoporous films possess electrochromic response times on the order of only seconds, which are attributable to the facilitated insertion of guest ions due to shortening of the diffusion path lengths. Also, the insertion/extraction reversibility of crystalline WO3 layers with 3D mesoporosity is improved compared to amorphous ones and reaches values close to 100 \%.},

	abstract = {Tungsten trioxide (WO3) electrochromic coatings have been formed on indium tin oxide-coated glass substrates by aqueous routes. Coating sols are obtained by dissolving tungsten powder in acetylated (APTA) or plain peroxotungstic acid (PTA) solutions. The structural evolution and electrochromic performance of the coatings as a function of calcination temperature (250 °C and 400 °C) have been reported. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction have shown that amorphous WO3 films are formed after calcination at 250 °C for both processing routes; however, the coatings that calcined at 400 °C were crystalline in both cases. The calcination temperature-dependent crystallinity of the coatings results in differences in optical properties of the coatings. Higher coloration efficiencies can be achieved with amorphous coatings than could be seen in the crystalline coatings. The transmittance values (at 800 nm) in the colored state are 35\% and 56\% for 250 °C and 400 °C-calcined coatings, respectively. The electrochemical properties are more significantly influenced by the method of sol preparation. The ion storage capacities designating the electrochemical properties are found in the range of 1.62–2.74 × 10− 3 (mC cm− 2) for APTA coatings; and 0.35–1.62 × 10− 3 (mC cm− 2) for PTA coatings. As a result, a correlation between the microstructure and the electrochromic performance has been established.},

Annealing induces chemical changes which are function of the initial coverage; for fractional coverage, annealing induces completion of oxidation of deposit whereas reduction to metallic tungsten occurs for highest coverage. These results demonstrate that interaction of W with TiO2(1 1 0) surface is, as the one of molybdenum, driven by a balance between W–O interactions and W–W depending on tungsten atoms density on TiO2 surface.},

Here, the fabrication and the measurement of inkjet-printed, air-processed organic solar cells is reported for the first time. Highly controlled conducting and semiconducting films using engineered inks for inkjet printing enable good efficiencies for printed OPVs between ≈2 and 5\% power conversion efficiency.

	abstract = {The microstructural aspects related to crystalline or amorphous structure of as-deposited and annealed films of sol–gel-derived WO3 are shown in the literature to be critical for electrochromic (EC) performance. In consideration of ion insertion materials, there is a need for developing light and at the same time nanocrystalline structures to improve both coloration efficiency and switching kinetics. By controlling microstructure and morphology, one could design a material with optimal EC performance. This report compares the microstructural and morphological characteristics of standard WO3 wet deposition techniques versus inkjet printing technology (IPT), correlating these features with their optical and electrochemical performances, emphasizing the importance of the dual-phase a-WO3/TiO2/WOX film composition proposed in this work for high-performance EC applications. The effect of the type and content of metal oxide nanoparticles in the precursor sols formulated in various peroxopolytungstic acid (PTA) and oxalic acid (OAD) proportions on film properties is comprehensively studied using multi-factorial design of experiment (DOE). To the authors' knowledge, no other report on sol–gel deposition of inorganic EC materials via the inkjet printing technique exists, in which furthermore the film crystallinity can be controlled under low-temperature process conditions. The proposed method enables development of EC films which irrespective of their composition (a-WO3, a-WO3/TiO2 or a-WO3/TiO2/WOX) outperform their amorphous or nanocrystalline analogues presented as the state-of-the-art due to their superior chemical and physical properties.},

The UV–vis spectra showed that the films extended the absorption wavelength into visible light range after being doped with 1–7\% (at.\%) content of W. Under the illumination of visible light, the W-TiO2 film showed a sensitive photocurrent response. Accordingly, the visible light photocatalytic degradation of dodecyl-benzenesulfonate (DBS) was tested and 5\% W-TiO2 film showed the highest degradation efficiency up to 84.8\% after 4-h treatment. When +1.0 V anodic bias potential and visible light were simultaneously applied, the degradation efficiency of DBS over the 5\% W-TiO2 film was significantly improved to 92\% after 90 min. The effects of anodic bias potential, initial pH value, and initial concentration of DBS on the PEC degradation of DBS were investigated.},

The structure and morphology of the nanoparticles are controlled by changing the acidity of the aqueous solvent added to the sol-gel precursor (peroxopolytungstic acid) during synthesis. Orthorhombic hydrated WO3 nanorods or monoclinic WO3 nanoslabs are obtained when HCl is added, while synthesis only in aqueous medium results in a mixture of both types of polymorphs. Dual-phase thin films are processed by inkjet printing deposition of the nanoparticles in flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate with indium tin oxide coating (ITO PET) followed by the deposition of the precursor solution. When compared with purely amorphous tungsten oxide films, the dual phase ones present higher optical densities and improved capacity, and cyclability stability. The best results, obtained for orthorhombic hydrated nanoparticles (ortho-WO3·0.33H2O), are due to its high surface area and improved conductivity. Additionally, the ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) lithiation studies show evidence of a higher distortion of the monoclinic when compared with the orthorhombic crystallographic structure, which contribute to the inferior EC performance. These results validate the use of inkjet printing deposition with low processing temperatures for EC dual-phase thin films containing optimized nanoparticles which are compatible with low-cost substrates.},

In particular we present evidence for charge trapping that facilitates recombination in these systems. For the PCDTBT:PC70BM system, an initial transient photocurrent peak 5–10 μs after turn-on is observed for operating voltages between 0.5 V and open-circuit. Furthermore, a long photocurrent tail is observed in the decay dynamics of PCDTBT:PC70BM devices with charge still being extracted hundreds of microseconds after turn-off. These features in the PCDTBT:PC70BM device are attributed to trapping and detrapping of charge on the microsecond time scale, with charge trapping facilitating recombination either through trap-assisted recombination or space-charge effects. For the PCPDTBT:PC70BM system, evidence for charge trapping is also observed albeit on a faster time scale. No initial transient photocurrent peak is observed, however the faster PCPDTBT:PC70BM decay dynamics show only a weak voltage dependence consistent with rapid trapping and recombination of charge. For both systems the amount of extracted charge as a function of applied voltage follows a similar form to the measured current-voltage curves providing evidence that photocurrent is hampered by the extraction, and not just the separation, of charge in these systems. The origin of charge trapping and the nature of recombination is discussed, along with the influence of additives on charge transport in the PCPDTBT:PC70BM system.},

	abstract = {The nature and time evolution of the primary excitations in the pristine conjugated polymer, PCDTBT, are investigated by femtosecond-resolved fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy. The extensive study includes data from PCDTBT thin film and from PCDTBT in chlorobenzene solution, compares the fluorescence dynamics for several excitation and emission wavelengths, and is complemented by polarization-sensitive measurements. The results are consistent with the photogeneration of mobile electrons and holes by interband π?π* transitions, which then self-localize within about 100 fs and evolve to a bound singlet exciton state in less than 1 ps. The excitons subsequently undergo successive migrations to lower energy localized states, which exist as a result of disorder. In parallel, there is also slow conformational relaxation of the polymer backbone. While the initial self-localization occurs faster than the time resolution of our experiment, the exciton formation, exciton migration, and conformational changes lead to a progressive relaxation of the inhomogeneously broadened emission spectrum with time constants ranging from about 500 fs to tens of picoseconds. The time scales found here for the relaxation processes in pristine PCDTBT are compared to the time scale ({\textless}0.2 ps) previously reported for photoinduced charge transfer in phase-separated PCDTBT:fullerene blends (Phys. Rev. B 2010, 81, 125210). We point out that exciton formation and migration in PCDTBT occur at times much longer than the ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer time in PCDTBT:fullerene blends. This disparity in time scales is not consistent with the commonly proposed idea that photoinduced charge separation occurs after diffusion of the polymer exciton to a fullerene interface. We therefore discuss alternative mechanisms that are consistent with ultrafast charge separation before localization of the primary excitation to form a bound exciton.},

Two linear polymers, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and polyethylenimine (PEI), are used to formulate stable complexes under specific pH to prepare polyaniline (PANI)/PAA-PEI multilayer films via LbL deposition. By introducing polymeric complexes as building blocks, [PANI/PAA-PEI]n films grow much faster compared with [PANI/PAA]n films, which are deposited under the same condition. Unlike the compact [PANI/PAA]n films, [PANI/PAA-PEI]n films exhibit porous structure that is beneficial to the electrochemical process and leads to improved electrochromic properties. An enhanced optical modulation of 30\% is achieved with [PANI/PAA-PEI]30 films at 630 nm compared with the lower optical modulation of 11\% measured from [PANI/PAA]30 films. The switching time of [PANI/PAA-PEI]30 films is only half of that of [PANI/PAA]30 films, which indicates a faster redox process. Utilizing polyelectrolyte complexes as building blocks is a promising approach to prepare fast growing LbL films for high performance electrochemical device applications.},

[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
The present study aims to determine the optimum radio frequency (RF) sputtering power to obtain the desired W-TiO2 nanotubes for the best photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. Tungsten (W) was deposited on titania (TiO2) nanotube arrays via RF sputtering technique under different sputtering powers from 50 to 250 W. The optimum content of W on TiO2 nanotube arrays play a significant role in maximizing the photocurrent generation efficiency to promote charge separation by accumulation of photogenerated electrons. The sputtering power below 180 W exhibited high-ordered and unbroken TiO2 nanotube arrays. However, the sputtering power over 180 W exhibited broken nanotube arrays and an oxide layer was formed due to the impact of high energy ions accelerated by a high sputtering power. The TiO2 nanotube arrays sputtered with tungsten at 50 W showed a better photocurrent density (1.55 mA/cm2), with a photoconversion efficiency of 2.2\% in the PEC performance among the samples due to the effective charge separation and reduced recombination center in the resultant W-TiO2 nanotubes.

	abstract = {An efficient mathematical strategy in the field of solution processed electrochromic (EC) films is outlined as a combination of an experimental work, modeling, and information extraction from massive computational data via statistical software. Design of Experiment (DOE) was used for statistical multivariate analysis and prediction of mixtures through a multiple regression model, as well as the optimization of a five-component sol?gel precursor subjected to complex constraints. This approach significantly reduces the number of experiments to be realized, from 162 in the full factorial (L = 3) and 72 in the extreme vertices (D = 2) approach down to only 30 runs, while still maintaining a high accuracy of the analysis. By carrying out a finite number of experiments, the empirical modeling in this study shows reasonably good prediction ability in terms of the overall EC performance. An optimized ink formulation was employed in a prototype of a passive EC matrix fabricated in order to test and trial this optically active material system together with a solid-state electrolyte for the prospective application in EC displays. Coupling of DOE with chromogenic material formulation shows the potential to maximize the capabilities of these systems and ensures increased productivity in many potential solution-processed electrochemical applications.},

Here, we present the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of new low bandgap polymers specifically for tandem polymer solar cells. These polymers have a backbone based on the benzodithiophene (BDT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units. Alkylthienyl and alkylphenyl moieties were incorporated onto the BDT unit to form BDTT and BDTP units, respectively; a furan moiety was incorporated onto the DPP unit in place of thiophene to form the FDPP unit. Low bandgap polymers (bandgap = 1.4?1.5 eV) were prepared using BDTT, BDTP, FDPP, and DPP units via Stille-coupling polymerization. These structural modifications lead to polymers with different optical, electrochemical, and electronic properties. Single junction solar cells were fabricated, and the polymer:PC71BM active layer morphology was optimized by adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. In the single-layer photovoltaic device, they showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3?6\%. When the polymers were applied in tandem solar cells, PCEs over 8\% were reached, demonstrating their great potential for high efficiency tandem polymer solar cells.},

Using the photocatalyst and under visible irradiation for 1.5 h, the decoloration percent of RB and carbon removal rate were about 98\% and 94\% respectively, which were much higher than that of commercial P25, TiO2, N-W-TiO2 and F-TiO2. The high visible-light photocatalytic activity of F-7NW-TiO2 might result from narrowing the band gap and lowing charge pairs recombination rate for the WxTi1−xO2, OTiN and valence variation of W ions existing.},

	abstract = {There have been a wide variety of efforts to develop conductive elastomers that satisfy both mechanical stretchability and electrical conductivity, as a response to growing demands on stretchable and wearable devices. This article reviews the important progress in conductive elastomers made in three application fields of stretchable technology: stretchable electronics, stretchable sensors, and stretchable energy harvesters. Diverse combinations of insulating elastomers and non-stretchable conductive materials have been studied to realize optimal conductive elastomers. It is noted that similar material combinations and similar structures have often been employed in different fields of application. In terms of stretchability, cyclic operation, and overall performance, fields such as stretchable conductors and stretchable strain/pressure sensors have achieved great advancement, whereas other fields like stretchable memories and stretchable thermoelectric energy harvesting are in their infancy. It is worth mentioning that there are still obstacles to overcome for the further progress of stretchable technology in the respective fields, which include the simplification of material combination and device structure, securement of reproducibility and reliability, and the establishment of easy fabrication techniques. Through this review article, both the progress and obstacles associated with the respective stretchable technologies will be understood more clearly.},

The surface-doped TiO2 powders exhibit photocatalytic activity in the order of Fe/TiO2 \&gt; Cu/TiO2 \&gt; V/TiO2 \&gt; W/TiO2 \&gt; Ce/TiO2 \&gt; Mn/TiO2. While the Fe, Cu and V ions improve the activity, the W, Ce, and Mn ions cause detrimental effects. The different influences are associated with their energy levels, coordination numbers and electronegativity. The surface-doped ions trap charge carriers and interact with adsorbates to provide alternative pathways for interfacial charge transfer. The Fe and Cu ions inhibit defect-mediated annihilation, facilitating interfacial charge transfer in terms of d–d transitions and thermally induced de-trapping. The Mn ions, which introduce both occupied and unoccupied states in the mid-band-gap region, in contrast, trap holes and electrons to severely consume charge carriers via intra-atomic relaxation. The Ce and W ions, which have high coordination numbers and electronegativity, strongly bond the O2− radicals, thus limiting charge utilization as well as photocatalytic performance.},

FTIR, Raman, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopic measurements showed that the vanadium oxide gel here synthesized consisted of V2O5·6H2O, microstructures similar to orthorhombic V2O5, while Raman spectroscopy also shows the presence of amorphous domains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films printed using an inkjet shows a ribbonlike structure, which is in accordance with previous results of the vanadium oxide gels in solution. Solid-state electrochromic devices were assembled at room temperature using the inkjet printed films, without any sinterization step. The electrochemical properties of the vanadium oxide gel were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry by visible/NIR absorption spectroscopy (in both liquid and solid-state). Several redox steps are observed, which gives rise to a variety of color transitions as a function of the applied voltage. The different optical properties of the vanadium oxide gel are assigned to different intercalation steps of Li+, leading to different crystalline phases of the gel. The final result is a solid-state electrochromic cell showing excellent contrast between the redox states, giving rise to colors such as yellow, green, or blue. Color space analysis was used to characterize the electrochromic transitions, and while absorption spectra showed rather long switching times (up to 100 s), in L*a*b* color space coordinates, the switching time is smaller than 30 s. These electrochromic cells also have an excellent cycling stability showing high reversibility and a cyclability up to more than 30?000 cycles with a degradation of 18\%.},

The photooxidation efficiency of WOx-TiO2 catalyst was also evaluated by conducting a set of experiments to photodegrade methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution. The photocatalytic activity of WOx-TiO2 was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–VIS absorption spectra, X-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectra (PL), surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) and electron-field-induced surface photovoltage spectra (EFISPS). The experiments demonstrated that the MB in aqueous solution was successfully photodegraded using WOx-TiO2 under visible light irradiation. It was found that an optimal WOx dosage of 3\% in WOx-TiO2 achieved the highest rate of MB photodegradation in this experimental condition. It has been confirmed that WOx-TiO2 could be excited by visible light (E\&lt;3.2 eV) and the recombination rate of electrons/holes in WOx-TiO2 declined due to the existence of WO3 doped in TiO2.

Analysis of the fitted Lambert W-function of illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics revealed increased recombination processes with increased active layer thicknesses. The ideality factor extracted from PCDTBT:PCBM solar cells continuously increased from 1.89 to 3.88 when photoactive layer thickness was increased from 70 to 150 nm. We found that such increase in ideality factor is closely related to the defect density which is increased with increased photoactive layer thickness beyond 110 nm. Therefore, the different density of defect states in PCDTBT:PCBM solar cells causes the different recombination paths where solar cells with a thicker active layer (⩾110 nm) are considered to undergo coupled trap-assisted recombination processes while single-defect trap-assisted recombination is dominant for thinner (70–90 nm) PCDTBT:PCBM solar cells. As a result, we found that the optimal efficiencies of PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells were limited to the active layers between 70 and 90 nm. Particularly, when PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells were optimized with an active layer thickness of 70 nm, energy conversion efficiency reached 6.5\% while an increase in thickness led to the reduction of efficiency to 4.7\% at 133 nm but then an increase to 5.02\% at 150 nm.},

	abstract = {Electrochromic smart windows are regarded as a good choice for green buildings. However, conventional devices need external biases to operate, which causes additional energy consumption. Here we report a self-powered electrochromic window, which can be used as a self-rechargeable battery. We use ​aluminium to reduce ​Prussian blue (​PB, blue in colour) to Prussian white (PW, colourless) in ​potassium chloride electrolyte, realizing a device capable of self-bleaching. Interestingly, the device can be self-recovered (gaining blue appearance again) by simply disconnecting the ​aluminium and ​PB electrodes, which is due to the spontaneous oxidation of PW to ​PB by the dissolved ​oxygen in aqueous solution. The self-operated bleaching and colouration suggest another important function of the device: a self-rechargeable transparent battery. Thus the PB/aluminium device we report here is bifunctional, that is, it is a self-powered electrochromic window as well as a self-rechargeable transparent battery.},

A retrofit EC window covering that could be readily applied to existing windows could have several economical advantages, particularly if it were photovoltaic (PV)-powered. Such a window covering could be produced on a flexible polymer substrate that would be adhered to the inside surface of a window. It could be conveniently replaced as newer, better coverings were developed and would not have to have as long a proven service lifetime as would a permanent window coating. A PV-EC window covering could also obviate the need for expensive electrical wiring for power and controls. Along with the advantages of a self-powered “smart” window covering come disadvantages and new technological challenges. In this paper, we will describe the design options and challenges associated with this retrofit concept which are presently being studied at NREL.},

This work aims to improve the electrochemical stability of silver-based transparent conductors. A silver grid/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film with high conductivity and excellent stability is successfully fabricated. Its functionality for flexible electrochromic applications is demonstrated by coating one layer of WO3 nanoparticles on the silver grid/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film. This hybrid structure presents a large optical modulation of 81.9\% at 633 nm, fast switching, and high coloration efficiency (124.5 cm2 C−1). More importantly, an excellent electrochemical cycling stability (sustaining 79.1\% of their initial transmittance modulation after 1000 cycles) and remarkable mechanical flexibility (optical modulation decay of only 7.5\% after 1200 compressive bending cycles) is achieved. A novel smart supercapacitor is presented that functions as a regular energy-storage device and simultaneously monitors the level of stored energy by a rapid and reversible color variation even at high current charge/discharge conditions. The film sustains an optical modulation of 87.7\% and a specific capacitance of 67.2\% at 10 A g−1 compared to their initial value at a current density of 1 A g−1. The high-performance silver grid/PEDOT:PSS hybrid transparent films exhibit promising features for various emerging flexible electronics and optoelectronic devices.},

The origin of the enhancement is clarified by studying the interfacial energy level alignment between PCDTBT or the 1:4 blended heterojunctions and PEDOT:PSS or NiOx using ultraviolet and inverse photoemission spectroscopies. The 1.6 eV electronic gap of PEDOT:PSS and energy level alignment with the BHJ result in poor hole selectivity of PEDOT:PSS and allows electron recombination at the PEDOT:PSS/BHJ interface. Conversely, the large band gap (3.7 eV) of NiOx and interfacial dipole (⩾0.6 eV) with the organic active layer leads to a hole-selective interface. This interfacial dipole yields enhanced electron blocking properties by increasing the barrier to electron injection. The presence of such a strong dipole is predicted to further promote hole collection from the organic layer into the oxide, resulting in increased fill factor and short circuit current. An overall decrease in recombination is manifested in an increase in open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency of the device on NiOx versus PEDOT:PSS interlayers.},

	abstract = {A series of nanosized W,N-codoped and single-doped N- and W-anatase-TiO2 catalysts have been prepared by a microemulsion method and calcined at different temperatures. The activity in the sunlight selective photo-oxidation of toluene and styrene has been correlated with structural, electronic, and surface examinations of the catalysts done with the help of XRD-Rietveld, N2 physisorption, X-ray photoelectron, infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopies. Irrespective of the reaction, W,N-codoped nanocatalysts showed an enhanced photoactivity with respect to bare anatase and single-doped N-TiO2 and W-TiO2 materials. A strong W–N synergistic interaction appears to play a decisive role in driving the excellent photoactivity performance of W,N-codoped materials by affecting (i) electronic properties, particularly maximizing the anatase band gap decrease and enhancing the subsequent visible light photon absorption, and (ii) surface properties, in turn related to the formation of OH radicals upon light excitation. The maximum photoactivity is reached by calcination at 450 °C and is concomitantly observed with a near complete selectivity to partial oxidation products. Higher calcination temperatures yielded solids with significantly inferior photocatalytic performance. The properties of the W–N interaction are discussed as a function of the calcination temperature.},

The crystallization temperature for the TiO2–M–TiO2 films decreased significantly compared with pure TiO2 film deposited on quartz. Detailed analysis of the Raman spectra suggested that the crystallization of TiO2–M–TiO2 films was associated with the large structural deformation imposed by the oxidation of intermediate metal layers. Moreover, the optical band gap of the films narrowed due to the appearance of impurity levels as the metal ions migrated into the TiO2 matrix. These results indicate that the insertion of intermediate metal layers provides a feasible access to improve the structural and optical properties of anatase TiO2 films, leading to promising applications in the field of photocatalysis.},

The nanometer-sized, metal-TiO2 photocatalyst samples, including Ba2+, Al3+, Si4+, V5+, and W6+ ions, were prepared by using the solvothermal method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the Ti-OH peak, which indicates hydrophilicity, increased with increasing Al and Si ion components but decreased with increasing Ba, V, and W ion components. The contact angles were distributed over the range of 0–10° on almost all films (200-nm thick) after irradiation for 2 h, and in particular approached 0° on the Al-TiO2 and Si-TiO2 nanometer-sized films after just 30 min. The toluene (100 ppm) photodecomposition in the continuous system increased in the order of Al-TiO2{\textgreater}Si-TiO2{\textgreater}pure TiO2{\textgreater}W-TiO2{\textgreater}Ba-TiO2{\textgreater}V-TiO2, and the maximum toluene conversion rate achieved was 45\% over Al-TiO2 film after 120 min. The toluene conversion remarkably increased; however, over all photocatalysts, with H2O addition during the toluene photo-decomposed reaction, and in particular, the conversion reached up to 90\% after 120 min over Al-TiO2 and Si-TiO2 with increased hydrophilicity. After photoreaction for 24 h, minimal carbon was deposited on the photocatalyst under both reaction conditions, with and without H2O addition, although the deposited carbon amounts were smaller for the former. These results confirmed that the hydrophilicity of the photocatalyst had a greater effect on toluene decomposition, while the photocatalytic deactivation could be retarded by H2O supplementation during toluene decomposition.},

	abstract = {The in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy of three tungsten oxide films was performed to study the electronic and atomic structures following repeated cycles of coloration and bleaching processes. The transparent tungsten oxide films become deep blue upon intercalation of Li+ ions in the WO6 octahedra when an external electrical bias was applied. These films reverted to transparent when a reverse external electrical bias was applied. W L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements of the nanocrystalline and crystalline tungsten oxide films revealed that the intensity of the white-line feature decreases after coloration and recoverably increases after bleaching owing to the filling and unfilling of the W 5d–O 2p conduction band states. The second derivative of the W L3-edge XANES spectra indicated an increase in structural disordering following repeated cycles of coloration and bleaching. However, the extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis showed that the nearest-neighbor W–O bond distances in the samples overall remain unchanged by coloration and bleaching. The nanocrystalline tungsten oxide film exhibited more effective recovery (∼97\% after first cycle) of the electronic structures than the other two crystalline samples in terms of the filling and unfilling of the W 5d–O 2p conduction band states after repeated coloration and bleaching. These results show that the nanocrystalline tungsten oxide sample has superior electrochromic properties to the crystalline samples.},

Here we demonstrate an origami lithium-ion battery that can be deformed at an unprecedented high level, including folding, bending and twisting. Deformability at the system level is enabled using rigid origami, which prescribes a crease pattern such that the materials making the origami pattern do not experience large strain. The origami battery is fabricated through slurry coating of electrodes onto paper current collectors and packaging in standard materials, followed by folding using the Miura pattern. The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and bendability. The strategy described here represents the fusion of the art of origami, materials science and functional energy storage devices, and could provide a paradigm shift for architecture and design of flexible and curvilinear electronics with exceptional mechanical characteristics and functionalities.},

TiO2 precursor films loaded with W+6 and Ag+2 ions (W–TiO2, Ag–TiO2) were prepared separately by sol-gel method and spin-coated on microscopic glass slides. As-dried films were subjected to KrF excimer laser pulses at optimized parameters to generate mesoporous anatase and rutile phases at room temperature. The anatase phase was obtained after irradiation with 10 laser pulses only at 75–85 mJ/cm2 fluence in W–TiO2 films. However, higher number of laser pulses and higher W+6 content favored the formation of rutile. Whereas Ag–TiO2 films exhibited anatase up to 200 laser pulses at the same fluence. The films were characterized by using XRD, FEG-SEM, TEM and UV-Vis spectrophotometer to investigate the crystallographic structure, phase transformation, surface morphology, film thickness and the optical properties. A crystallite size of approximately 20 nm was achieved from the anatase prepared by SGLIT. The films exhibited an enhanced antibacterial function against E-Coli cells under the UV excitation.},

X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the cubic γ-phase of CuI. A Kelvin probe measurement technique is utilized to identify the effective work function of CuI coated ITO. The device optimization is done by varying the concentration of CuI in the precursor solution which played an important role in the efficiency of the solar cell devices.

The new photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–vis-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. The photoactivity of the W–TiO2 photocatalysts was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation of Congo red (CR) dye. It was found that the average size of the prepared photocatalysts is 10 nm. Moreover, they have high surface areas (∼ 216 m2 g−1) and their light-absorption extends to the visible region compared to pure TiO2. The effects of W-loading and of the calcination temperature of the prepared photocatalysts on their photocatalytic activity were also studied. The obtained results show that the W0.5–TiO2 photocatalyst calcined at 350 °C is much highly photoactive than non-doped or highly doped TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the weakly doped TiO2 may be attributed to the increase in the charge separation efficiency and the presence of surface acidity on the W0.5–TiO2 photocatalyst.},

	abstract = {The precise mechanism and dynamics of charge generation and recombination in bulk heterojunction polymer:fullerene blend films typically used in organic photovoltaic devices have been intensively studied by many research groups, but nonetheless remain debated. In particular the role of interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states in the generation of free charge carriers, an important step for the understanding of device function, is still under active discussion. In this article we present direct optical probes of the exciton dynamics in pristine films of a prototypic polycarbazole-based photovoltaic donor polymer, namely poly[N-11′′-henicosanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), as well as the charge generation and recombination dynamics in as-cast and annealed photovoltaic blend films using methanofullerene (PC61BM) as electron acceptor. In contrast to earlier studies we use broadband (500–1100 nm) transient absorption spectroscopy including the previously unobserved but very important time range between 2 ns and 1 ms, which allows us not only to observe the entire charge carrier recombination dynamics but also to quantify the existing decay channels. We determine that ultrafast exciton dissociation occurs in blends and leads to two separate pools of products, namely Coulombically bound charge-transfer (CT) states and unbound (free) charge carriers. The recombination dynamics are analyzed within the framework of a previously reported model for poly(3-hexylthiophene):PCBM (Howard, I. A.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 14866) based on concomitant geminate recombination of CT states and nongeminate recombination of free charge carriers. The results reveal that only ∼11\% of the initial photoexcitations generate interfacial CT states that recombine exclusively by fast nanosecond geminate recombination and thus do not contribute to the photocurrent, whereas ∼89\% of excitons create free charge carriers on an ultrafast time scale that then contribute to the extracted photocurrent. Despite the high yield of free charges the power conversion efficiency of devices remains moderate at about 3.0\%. This is largely a consequence of the low fill factor of devices. We relate the low fill factor to significant energetic disorder present in the pristine polymer and in the polymer:fullerene blends. In the former we observed a significant spectral relaxation of exciton emission (fluorescence) and in the latter of the polaron-induced ground-state bleaching, implying that the density of states (DOS) for both excitons and charge carriers is significantly broadened by energetic disorder in pristine PCDTBT and in its blend with PCBM. This disorder leads to charge trapping in solar cells, which in turn causes higher carrier concentrations and more significant nongeminate recombination. The nongeminate recombination has a significant impact on the IV curves of devices, namely its competition with charge carrier extraction causes a stronger bias dependence of the photocurrent of devices, in turn leading to the poor device fill factor. In addition our results demonstrate the importance of ultrafast free carrier generation and suppression of interfacial CT-state formation and question the applicability of the often used Braun–Onsager model to describe the bias dependence of the photocurrent in polymer:fullerene organic photovoltaic devices.},

	abstract = {Self-powered ‘smart’ windows for active control of building heating and cooling represent a potential new market for amorphous-silicon based photovoltaics. Retrofit applications to existing windows are facilitated by the tandem photovoltaic-electrochromic (PV-EC) device, in which a wide-gap amorphous silicon-based alloy (a-SiC:H) photovoltaic cell is deposited together with an EC optical transmittance modulator in a monolithic coating on a single substrate. In this paper, studies of transparent wide-gap a-SiC:H thin-films and p-i-n cells designed for use in the PV-EC device are described. Using optimized a-SiC:H i-layer material, Jsc of 3.9 mA/cm2 and Voc of 0.92 V is achieved, adequate to color our low-voltage Li-based EC devices in less than one minute, and good progress toward the required transparency is shown.},

	abstract = {TiO2 films were heavily doped with W (TiO2:W) by simultaneous rf magnetron sputtering of TiO2, and dc magnetron sputtering of W. The advantage of this method is that the W content could be changed in a wide range. The coexistence of TiO2, WO3 and TiWO5 in the TiO2:W film was detected by XPS analysis. Besides, tungsten in TiO2:W film on the bare glass may form mixed valence of W0+ and W6+. Electrical conductivity was primarily due to the contribution of oxygen vacancies and W donors (WTi). When the film thickness increased, the TiO2:W film showed higher carrier concentration and higher mobility. Furthermore, the resistivity and the transmission decreased obviously with film thickness. On comparing with the TiO2:W film deposited on the bare glass, the TiO2:W film on the Al2O3-deposited glass exhibited lower surface roughness, lower resistivity, higher optical energy gap, higher optical transmission, and lower stress-optical coefficient.},

The catalyst was prepared by sol–gel method and hydrothermally treated before used in the solar photocatalytic degradation of an azo dye, acid red 1 (AR1). To verify the effectiveness of the composite catalyst, two commercial photocatalysts; Degussa P25 and TiO2-Sigma product CAS No. 1317-70-0 were used in the solar degradation of AR1 for the purpose of comparison. The performance of the composite catalyst excelled that of TiO2-Sigma product, but was as good as Degussa P25 in terms of the solar photodegradation. Nevertheless, it has an added merit of quick settling out of solution (a quality which was lacking in Degussa P25) and could be reused. The reusability test proved that the catalyst was as good at the fourth cycle as at the first. Effects of pH and initial dye concentrations on the solar degradation of AR1 were also studied. The study revealed that while solution pH exerted a great influence on the degradation of the dye, initial dye concentrations did not. The chemical states of the catalysts were studied by XPS, while other characterizations were carried out by FT-IR, XRD, SSEM and BET.},

Their electronic structure and optical properties were studied by means of first-principle. Photocatalytic (PC) performance of W-TNAs photoelectrodes with different crystal structures was evaluated using the decomposition rates of Rhodamine B (Rh.B) under xenon light illumination. The results demonstrated that W substituting Ti broadened the width of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of anatase and rutile TiO2, reduced the band gap of rutile TiO2 and even caused its red-shift. W incorporated into TNAs photoelectrodes extended light absorption threshold and enhanced its utilization of solar light and PC activity, particularly, the PC performance of W-TNAs photoelectrodes with mixed crystal and rutile crystal structure.},

In this paper, we have fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cells based on PCDTBT and PC71BM (structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (80 nm)). In order to optimize the performance of the cells, the weight ratio of PCDTBT to PC71BM, the thickness of the active layer and thermal annealing are investigated. When the weight ratio of PCDTBT to PC71BM is 1:2 and the thickness of the active layer is 73 nm, a short circuit current density of 10.36 mA/cm(2), an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V, a fill factor of 55.06 \% and a power conversion efficiency of 5.19 \% can be achieved. Moreover, we probe the influence of annealing temperature on the performance of organic solar cells, and find that the thermal treatment methodology (apart from the removal of trapped casting solvent) is of limited benefit.},

	abstract = {Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are able to vary their throughput of visible light and solar energy by the application of an electrical voltage and are able to provide energy efficiency and indoor comfort in buildings. Section 1 explains why this technology is important and timely by first outlining today's precarious situation concerning increasing energy use and associated effects on the world's climate, and this section also underscores the great importance of enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings by letting them function more in harmony with the environment—particularly its varying temperature—than is possible with current mainstream technologies. This same chapter also surveys recent work on the energy savings and other benefits that are possible with EC-based technologies. Section 2 then provides some notes on the history of the EC effect and its applications. Section 3 presents a generic design for the oxide-based EC devices that are most in focus for present-day applications and research. This design includes five superimposed layers with a centrally-positioned electrolyte connecting two oxide films—at least one of which having EC properties—and with transparent electrical conductors surrounding the three-layer structure in the middle. It is emphasized that this construction can be viewed as a thin-film electrical battery whose charging state is manifested as optical absorption. Also discussed are six well known hurdles for the implementation of these EC devices, as well as a number of practical constructions of EC-based smart windows. Section 4 is an in-depth discussion of various aspects of EC oxides. It begins with a literature survey for 2007–2013, which updates earlier reviews, and is followed by a general discussion of optical and electronic effects and, specifically, on charge transfer absorption in tungsten oxide. Ionic effects are then treated with foci on the inherent nanoporosity of the important EC oxides and on the possibilities to accomplish further porosity by having suitable thin-film deposition parameters. A number of examples on the importance of the detailed deposition conditions are presented, and Section 4 ends with a presentation of the EC properties of films with compositions across the full tungsten–nickel oxide system. Section 5 is devoted to transparent electrical conductors and electrolytes, both of which are necessary in EC devices. Detailed surveys are given of transparent conductors comprising doped-oxide semiconductors, coinage metals, nanowire meshes and other alternatives, and also of electrolytes based on thin films and on polymers. Particular attention is devoted to electrolyte functionalization by nanoparticles. Section 6 considers one particular device construction: A foil that is suitable for glass lamination and which, in the author's view, holds particular promise for low-cost large-area implementation of EC smart windows. Device data are presented, and a discussion is given of quality assessment by use of 1/f noise. The “battery-type” EC device covered in the major part of this critical review is not the only alternative, and Section 7 consists of brief discussions of a number of more or less advanced alternatives such as metal hydrides, suspended particle devices, polymer-dispersed liquid crystals, reversible electroplating, and plasmonic electrochromism based on transparent conducting oxide nanoparticles. Finally, Section 8 provides a brief summary and outlook. The aim of this critical review is not only to paint a picture of the state-of-the-art for electrochromics and its applications in smart windows, but also to provide ample references to current literature of particular relevance and thereby, hopefully, an easy entrance to the research field.},

	abstract = {Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) block co-polymers (PEO–PPO–PEO, sold as Pluronics, Poloxamers, Tetronics) are a widely used class of amphiphilic materials for different biological applications. In fact for certain members of the Pluronics series, the interactions of block segments with living cells alter the lipid membrane properties and facilitate the permeation of drugs. A fuller understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning these interactions is essential for ensuring their safety and efficacy in biomedical applications and to inform the design of new amphiphilic copolymers for potential use in a clinical setting. In this paper, by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and membrane lysis assays, we investigate the relationship between the molecular conformations of a subset of the Pluronic copolymers (L31, L61, L62 and L64) and their haemolytic activity. Our computational studies suggest that the hydrophilic blocks in these copolymers interact with the polar head groups of lipid molecules, resulting in a predicted modification of the structure of the membranes. Parallel membrane lysis assays in human erythrocytes indicate differences in the rates of haemolysis, as a result of incubation with these polymers, that correlate well with the predicted interactions from the atomistic simulations. The computational data thus provide a putative mechanism to rationalize the available experimental data on membrane lysis by these copolymers and quantitatively agree with haemoglobin release endpoints measured when copolymers with the same molecular weight and structure as of those modelled are incubated with erythrocytes. The data further suggest some new structure–function relationships at the nanoscale that are likely to be of importance in determining the biological activity of these otherwise inert copolymers.},

In the present investigation, honeycomb nanostructured WO3 with different unit size and nanowire array with highly nanocrystalline frameworks have been synthesized via a hydrothermal technique. The influence of hydrothermal reaction time on the honeycomb unit cells, crystallite size, lithium ion diffusion coefficient and switching time for coloration/bleaching were studied systematically. The electrochromic study reveals that the honeycomb unit cell size has a significant impact on the electrochromic performance. Small unit cells in the honeycomb lead to large optical modulation and fast switching response. A large optical modulation in the visible spectral region (60.74\% at λ = 630 nm) at a potential of −1.2 V with fast switching time (4.29 s for coloration and 3.38 s for bleaching) and high coloration efficiency (87.23 cm2 C−1) is observed in the honeycomb WO3 thin films with a unit cell diameter of 1.7 μm. The variation in color on reduction of WO3 with applied potential has been plotted on an xy-chromaticity diagram and the color space coordinate shows the transition from a colorless to deep blue state.},

The adsorption rate constant obtained from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was in the order of 1:287:adsorption:reaction, which is so negligible. This is an indication that the process did not obey the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model. Therefore, the degradation recorded in this study was as a result of the properties of the composite photocatalyst. Large specific surface area, reduced band gap which also inhibited electron–hole recombination, high crystallinity of the composite photocatalyst were responsible for its efficiency. The photocatalytic process in this study is best described by the first order irreversible reaction rate/order. A comparison of the efficiency of the photocatalyst with a commercially available photocatalyst, TiO2–Sigma product and other photocatalysts in literature placed the composite photocatalyst at an excellent position above the commercial and others available in literature for the degradation of 2,4-D. Within the limits of the experiment, the amount of 2,4-D degraded per unit time was found to be proportional to its initial concentrations, and the unadjusted solution pH 4.232 was found to be the best for the process.},

	abstract = {A “nano to nano” electrodeposition approach for preparing nano-structured thin films from the dispersion of nano-objects is reported. A typical WO3 system is demonstrated, where nanocrystalline films are electrodeposited onto transparent conductive electrodes such as ITO and Ag grid printed PET (Ag grid/PET) from the water dispersion of WO3 nanoparticles without applying high potential, adding surfactants or polymers. The process is based on the reduction of WO3, which eliminates the electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles causing film deposition on the cathode. The reduced WO3 (HWO3) is conductive, thus it allows further film growth towards higher thickness and coverage. The electrodeposited films consist of stacked crystalline nanoparticles, which provide a highly active surface area, facilitate the penetration of electrolyte and the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ in the nanocrystals and therefore result in outstanding electrochromic performance and stability (92\% contrast, 9 s coloring and 15 s bleaching, retaining 76\% contrast after 1000 coloring–bleaching cycles). The thickness, electrochromic performance and surface coverage of the films are well tuned by potential and time. This novel “nano to nano” electrodeposition approach based on the electrochemical redox of nano-objects can be extended to various transition metal oxide nano-objects with different sizes and shapes.},

The photoactive layer of these visibly transparent polymer solar cells harvests solar energy from the near-infrared region while being less sensitive to visible photons. The top transparent electrode employs a highly transparent silver nanowire?metal oxide composite conducting film, which is coated through mild solution processes. With this combination, we have achieved 4\% power-conversion efficiency for solution-processed and visibly transparent polymer solar cells.

Correlation of electrical measurements on complete devices and UV-vis absorption measurements as well as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis on the active materials reveals that photodimerization of PC60BM is responsible for the observed degradation. Simulation of the electrical device parameters shows that this dimerization results in a significant reduction of the charge carrier mobility. Both the dimerization and the associated device performance loss turn out to be reversible upon annealing. BisPC60BM, the bis-substituted analog of PC60BM, is shown to be resistant towards light exposure, which in turn enables the manufacture of photostable PDTSTzTz:bisPC60BM solar cells.},

Thin films Ag-doped CuO are deposited on the substrate by co-sputtering followed by microwave assisted oxidation of the metal films. The low temperature tolerance of the polymer substrates led to the search for innovative low temperature processing techniques. Cupric oxide is a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band gap and is used as selective absorption layer solar cells. X-ray diffraction identifies the CuO phases. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry measurements confirm the stoichiometry of each copper oxide formed. The surface morphology is determined by atomic force microscopy. The microstructural properties such as crystallite size and the microstrain for (−111) and (111) planes are calculated and discussed. Incorporation of Ag led to the lowering of band gap in CuO. Consequently, it is determined that Ag addition has a strong effect on the structural, morphological, surface, and optical properties of CuO grown on flexible substrates by microwave annealing. Tauc\&apos;s plot is used to determine the optical band gap of CuO and Ag doped CuO films. The values of the indirect and direct band gap for CuO are found to be 2.02 eV and 3.19 eV, respectively.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the processes occurring during V–O–W unsupported catalyst formation in order to gain the knowledge necessary to design supported catalysts. Sol–gel synthesis of V–W hydroxo-oxide hydrate (W:V=9:1) from tungsten and vanadyl isopropoxides is described. The hydrate structure is shown to be related to WO3·0.33H2O. The role of vanadium in the formation of this structure is discussed. Hydrate dehydration is shown to result in the formation of V–W hydroxo-oxide isostructural with hexagonal WO3. Further heating of hydroxy-oxide causes a loss of hydroxy groups accompanied by the formation of V–W oxide bronze isostructural with tetragonal WO3. Annealing the bronze in an air atmosphere results in the removal of vanadium from the bronze crystallites as a results of its surface segregation. The formation of the surface vanadia-like species on WO3-related crystallites is found to be a result of vanadium segregation. Increasing the annealing temperature causes recrystallisation of the surface species. The synthesis of a V–W/TiO2 oxide catalyst via a mixed oxide formation in the presence of titania sols followed, by surface vanadium segregation in an air containing atmosphere, is proposed. The application of the knowledge gained during our investigation of the formation of the unsupported V–O–W catalyst to the discussion of the morphology of the V–O–W/Ti(Sn)O2 (rutile) catalyst is also demonstrated.},

The printed EC thin films were then laminated with a solid transparent thin film electrolyte and a transparent conductive thin film to form an ECD. After applying a dc voltage, the printed ECDs exhibited great contrast with a transmittance change (ΔT) of 40.1\% and a high coloration efficiency of 445 cm2 C–1 within a short darkening time of 2 s. The flexible ECDs also showed the same darkening time of 2 s and still had a high ΔT of 30.1\% under bending condition.

	abstract = {Wide-gap, transparent amorphous silicon based photovoltaics can be integrated with electrochromic materials to produce a self-powered 'smart' window coating. Existing electrochromic window designs require an external electrical connection, which may be economically unfeasible. This problem is solved by the tandem photovoltaic-electrochromic (PV/EC) device, in which a wide-gap amorphous silicon-based alloy (a-SiC:H) photovoltaic device is deposited together with an electrochromic optical transmittance modulator in a monolithic device on a single substrate. In this paper, we discuss our proposed monolithic photovoltaic-electrochromic device. We also present studies of transparent, wide-gap (Tauc gap of 1.8 to 2.2 eV) amorphous silicon-carbon thin films and p-i-n devices designed for use in the photovoltaic-electrochromic device. The photovoltaic cells in the PV-EC can operate at low current ({\textless} 1 mA/cm2) because a total injected charge of only 60 (mu) C/cm2 will darken the EC layer to a visible transmission of 5\%, but they will need a high open-circuit voltage ({\textgreater} 1.0 V) and high transparency (approximately equals 70\%). We describe our progress toward these design targets.},

The larger magnitude of the indirect band gap shift to blue than the direct gap shift for the same level of lithium intercalation (18 mC cm −2 ) and the irreversibility of the direct gap shift upon bleaching are characteristic of the nanocrystalline structure of the film. The moderate decline in the anodic peak current maximum, the diffusion coefficient for lithium and the optical modulation at 632.8 nm upon repetitive switching between the coloured and bleached states ratified that nanostructured films sustain 1000 cycles without much deterioration.},

The electrochromic coatings having a thickness 300 nm were prepared by dipping technique. Out of the wide range of curing temperature (60-400 degreesC), the films cured at similar to200 degreesC for 1 h exhibited good electrochromic effect. Electrochromic properties of the tungsten oxide coatings were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using a three-electrode cell system with 0.01 M HCl as an electrolyte. Cyclic voltamograms have been recorded ranging from -1.50 to 0.75 Vat a scan rate range of 0.010-0.005 V s(-1). In aqueous medium, the coloration {\textless}----{\textgreater} bleaching could not be continued more than five to eight cycles for acid to the corrosion Of WO3 films- If lithium-based nonaqueous electrolyte is used for this purpose, the coatings withstood more than 500 cycles. It is suggested that the films obtained after curing at requisite temperature for having the coloration {\textless}----{\textgreater} bleaching effect contained mainly with the W-O-W bonding pattern in orthorhombic crystalline phase.

	abstract = {Porous orthorhombic tungsten oxide (o-WO3) thin films, stabilized by nanocrystalline anatase TiO2, are obtained by a sol–gel based two stage dip coating method and subsequent annealing at 600 °C. An Organically Modified Silicate (ORMOSIL) based templating strategy is adopted to achieve porosity. An asymmetric electrochromic device is constructed based on this porous o-WO3 layer. The intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions into/from the o-WO3 layer of the device as a function of applied coloration/bleaching voltages have been studied. XRD measurements show systematic changes in the lattice parameters associated with structural phase transitions from o-WO3 to tetragonal LixWO3 (t-LixWO3) and a tendency to form cubic LixWO3 (c-LixWO3). These phase transitions, induced by the Li ions, are reversible, and the specific phase obtained depends on the quantity of intercalated/deintercalated Li. Raman spectroscopy data show the formation of t-LixWO3 for an applied potential of 1.0 V and the tendency of the system to transform to c-LixWO3 for higher coloration potentials. Optical measurements show excellent contrasts between colored and bleached states. An alternate photochromic device was constructed by sensitizing the o-WO3 layer with a ruthenium based dye. The nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 in the o-WO3 layer has led to an enhanced photochromic optical transmittance contrast of ∼51\% in the near IR region. The combination of the photochromic and electrochromic properties of the synthesised o-WO3 layer stabilized by nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 opens up new vista for its application in energysaving smart windows.},

The electrochromic and optical properties of the mesoporous films are described and compared to standard sol–gel tungsten oxide films. Results are also presented on the samples prepared by thermal treatment.

	abstract = {The current developments on organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are inspired by the idea that they can be processed from solution. One of the challenges in developing fully solution-processed OPV devices is the design of well-performing electrodes with low cost of deposition. This has been one of the focus of the academic and industrial community. Nowadays, the use of ITO as a semitransparent electrode has become a bottleneck. This is because it is brittle, has Indium (a rare element), and needs a high energy intensive deposition process. There are many alternatives presented but none of them match the performance of ITO. Here, we report a full solution-processed ITO-free semitransparent OPV device based on silver nanowires (Ag NWs). To demonstrate the potential of Ag NWs in OPV devices, they were employed as a bottom and top electrode without a post treatment to decrease their roughness. Record devices achieved only a decrease of 6.5\% of efficiency in comparison to ITO based reference devices. Furthermore, due to its good bending properties, a working stretchable device was fabricated by depositing the different OPV layers on a pre-stretched elastomeric membrane. These results indicate that Ag NWs can successfully replace ITO as an electrode.},

The DSC is currently the most efficient and stable excitonic photocell. Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle DSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline ZnO nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5\% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.},

	abstract = {Smart glass is such that its properties may be changed by application of a potential across it. The change in properties may be engineered to alter the amount of heat energy that can penetrate the glass which provides heating and cooling design options. Therein lies its potential in energy savings. Smart glass may be classified into three types: electrochromic, suspended particle, and polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC). Each of these types has their own mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages. Electrochromic smart glass is the most popular, currently it utilizes an electrochromic film with an ion storage layer and ion conductor placed between two transparent plates. The electrochromic film is usually made of tungsten oxide, owing to the electrochromic nature of transition metals. An electric potential initiates a redox reaction of the electrochromic film transitioning the color and the transparency of the smart glass. Suspended particle smart glass has needle shaped particles suspended within an organic gel placed between two electrodes. In its off state, the particles are randomly dispersed and have a low light transmittance. Once a voltage is applied, the needle particles will orient themselves to allow for light to pass through. PDLC smart glass works similarly to the suspended particle variety. However, in PDLC smart glass, the central layer is a liquid crystal placed within a polymer matrix between electrodes. Similar in behavior to the suspended particles, in the off position the liquid crystals are randomly dispersed and have low transmittance. With the application of a voltage, the liquid crystals orient themselves, thereby allowing for the transmittance of light. These different smart glasses have many different applications, but with one hindrance. The requirement of a voltage source is a major disadvantage which greatly complicates the overall installation and manufacturing processes. However, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) devices into smart glass technology has provided one solution. Photovoltaic films attached in the smart glass will provide the necessary voltage source. The photovoltaic film may even be designed to produce more voltage than needed. The use a photovoltaic smart glass system provides significant cost savings in regards to heating, cooling, lighting, and overall energy bills. Smart glass represents a technology with a great deal of potential to reduce energy demand. Action steps have been identified to propagate the popular use of smart glass.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a simulation study of the energy and CO2 benefits of a transparent, near-infrared switching electrochromic (NEC) glazing for building applications. NEC glazings are an emerging dynamic window technology that can modulate the transmission of NIR heat without affecting transmission of visible light. In this study, a hypothetical NEC glazing is simulated on clear and tinted glass in six building type models in 16 U.S. climate regions using Energy Plus 7.1. The total annual energy consumption for lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation for the NEC glazings are compared with high performance static windows and conventional tungsten-oxide EC glazings. Using regional CO2 intensities and building stock totals, the results from individual building model simulations are scaled up to national totals. The U.S. national savings from NEC deployment is found to be 167 TWh/yr (600 PJ/yr) compared to the existing building stock, but only 8 TWh/yr (29 PJ/yr) or 1.56 million tonnes of CO2 per year when compared to high performance static glazings with lighting controls installed.

NEC performance varied significantly by building type and location. This analysis reveals that 50\% of the total energy savings can be realized by deploying NEC glazings in only 18\% of the total window stock, and 75\% of the savings in only 39\% of the stock. The best performing locations include medium offices and midrise residential buildings in northern climates, where energy savings per unit window area range from 50 to 200 kWh/m2-yr.},

These parameters concern a number of electrical, thermal and optical properties which depend on the structural composition and configuration of the electrochromic device. In this paper a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the optimal performance requirements of electrochromic windows from the perspective of building energy efficiency and indoor comfort has been carried out. A comparison with the performance of a home-made fully solid-state electrochromic device tested in laboratory controlled conditions and of large-area electrochromic glazing currently available in the market is also made. The study points out the actual potential of the electrochromic technology for smart window applications and identifies some desirable performance improvements for optimizing building integration.},

	abstract = {Driven by the tremendous opportunities offered by dye solar cells technology in terms of building integration, a new generation of smart multifunctional photoelectrochemical cells has the potential to attract the interest of a rapidly growing number of research institutions and industrial companies. Photovoltachromic devices are capable to produce a smart modulation of the optical transmittance and, at the same time, to generate electrical power by means of solar energy conversion. In this work, a specifically designed bifunctional counterelectrode has been realized by depositing a C-shaped platinum frame which bounds a square region occupied by a tungsten oxide (WO3) film onto a transparent conductive substrate. These two regions have been electrically separated to make possible distinct operations on one or both of the available circuits. Such an unconventional counterelectrode makes it possible to achieve a twofold outcome: a smart and fast-responsive control of the optical transmittance and a relatively high photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In particular we investigated the effect of the electrolyte composition on both photoelectrochromic and photovoltaic performances of such devices by systematically tuning the iodide content in the electrolyte. The best result was obtained by filling the cell with an iodine concentration of 0.005 M: a coloration efficiency of 61.10 cm2C−1 at a wavelength of 780 nm and, at the same time, a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 6.55\% have been reported.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaics (PV) is a potential alternative to the world's quickly depleting fossil fuel and can be a mean of curtailing green-house gas emissions as well. In regions in which there is a shortage of free land and no fossil fuel reserves, building-integrated photovoltaics with an additional attribute of semitransparency (BISTPV) can help to realize sustainable economic growth. The net electricity savings in dwellings and commercial edifices can be substantially enhanced by using BISTPV shrewdly. In addition to building applications, semitransparent (ST) solar cells can be used in yacht hatches, signboards on express-ways, automobiles, electronic displays, and other applications. It is anticipated that in the foreseeable future, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells, and chalcopyrite solar cells based BISTPV modules will replace aesthetically repulsive c-Si-based ST modules, which are currently the key player in the BIPV market. DSSCs are superior to a-Si:H and chalcopyrite-based PV in terms of the appropriate choice of dyes, for which wavelengths that have a low eye sensitivity factor can be selectively harnessed. The transparency, or ability to see-through, can be further increased by making use of highly transparent photoanodes and counter electrodes. However, the stability issues that are associated with DSSCs have halted their propagation to the BIPV market. In contrast, ST a-Si:H solar cells have been well developed on a laboratory scale, and ST panels made by various companies are available on the market. Apart from ST DSSCs and a-Si:H solar cells, which have evolved considerably, chalcopyrite STPV has only recently started the journey of its development on a laboratory scale although it has a large potential for BISTPV. Therefore, considerable efforts must be made for it to emerge in the BIPV market. This article will present a detailed review of the material requirements for fabricating ST dye-sensitized-, amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)-, and chalcopyrite-based solar cells, especially for BIPV applications. Furthermore, the present status and future prospects of semitransparent photovoltaics (STPV) and strategies to enhance photocurrent in STPV will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {An innovative tunable photovoltaic electrochromic (PV–EC) device concept, in which planar distribution of silicon thin film solar cells (Si-TFSCs) structure with successively deposited electrochromic thin films (ECTFs) and electrolyte layer is demonstrated. The switching mechanism of a PV–EC device is realized by electrically separating the electrodes of the Si-TFSCs and ECTFs, and the connection of the two systems is achieved through an external switching apparatus that links each Si-TFSC and ECTF through one transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. According to the PV–EC device structure, Si-TFSCs arranged in stripes makes large area module fabrication feasible, while Si-TFSCs arranged in arrays allows pixel structure design possible. When illuminated by sunlight under short-circuit condition, the photopotential outputted from a single Si-TFSC drives ECTF layer to change color, simultaneously a portion of the photocurrent is stored in a capacitor. Once the ECTF is tinted, no power is needed to retain its colored state due to the bi-stable property of the electrochromic material. In order to revert the PV–EC device to its bleached state, the capacitor supplies reverse potential to cause discoloration of the ECTF. In addition, the monolithically integrated Si-TFSC module generates electricity to a connected load. In view of photoelectric conversion and optical modulation properties, the PV–EC device can both function as a Si-TFSC module and as a self powered smart glass, which has great advantages in green energy application.},

	abstract = {Re-thinking our relationship with energy resources and environmental equilibrium, towards anthropogenic sustainability, calls for innovative and energetically wise technologies. Smart devices adjusting their optical behaviour depending on the environmental conditions will allow remarkable energy savings. To this end, photoelectrochromic devices (PECDs) have captured, in the last two decades, the interest of many research groups and industrial players worldwide. These devices encompass a dual behavior, being able to generate energy and, concomitantly, deliver a smart optical response. For this reason, they are the ideal skins of future buildings, capable of modulating their behavior in response to changing external stimuli, like sunlight irradiance. PECDs have a wide range of applications, from solar shading in architectural glazing to rear view mirrors in automotives, or avionics. This review article explores the different design concepts standing at the basis of the devices that have appeared so far, shedding light on future perspectives. This work takes into account R\&amp;D issues and processing constraints as well as the potential exploitation of emerging solid-state materials promising important technological progress.},

Each individual smart pixel device combines an electrochemical transistor with an electrochromic display cell, thus resulting in a low-voltage operating and robust display technology. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) served as the active material in the electrochemical smart pixels, as well as the conducting lines, of the monolithically integrated active-matrix display. Different active-matrix display addressing schemes have been investigated and a matrix display fill factor of 65 \% was reached. This is achieved by combining a three-terminal electrochemical transistor with an electrochromic display cell architecture, in which an additional layer of PEDOT:PSS was placed on top of the display cell counter electrode. In addition, we have evaluated different kinds of electrochromic polymer materials aiming at reaching a high color switch contrast. This work has been carried out in the light of achieving a robust display technology that is easily manufactured using a standard label printing press, which forced us to use the fewest different materials as well as avoiding exotic and complex device architectures. Together, this yields a manufacturing process of only five discrete patterning steps, which in turn promise for that the active matrix addressed displays can be manufactured on paper or plastic substrates in a roll-to-roll production procedure.},

	abstract = {Monolithic integration of an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) and an organic electrochromic display cell operating at around 1 V is reported. This was achieved by utilising a common patterned layer of poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH). In the OFET, PSSH served as the electric double layer capacitors between the gate and the organic semiconductor channel. In the electrochromic pixel, PSSH was included as the electrolyte and transports protons from and to the electrochromic layer upon switching. The enhancement mode OFET enables a relatively faster updating speed, of the display cell, and provides a much simpler addressing and updating scheme as compared to smart pixels including a depletion mode electrochemical transistor.},

Each organic electrochromic display (OECD) pixel and its corresponding organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) are located on different sides of the flexible PET substrate. Electronic vias generated through the plastic substrate connects each OECD pixel with one addressing OECT. When comparing this display with actively addressed OECDs with all its components located on the same side, the present approach based on this electronic via substrate provides an enhanced pixel resolution and a relatively more simplified manufacturing process. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Hole transport layers (HTLs) with large work function (WF) tuning ability for good energy level alignment with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level donor materials are desirable for high-performance and high open-circuit voltage (VOC) organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a novel low-temperature and solution-process approach to achieve WF tuning in HTLs is proposed. Specifically, the HTLs made from 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzylphosphonic acid (F5BnPA) incorporated graphene oxide (GO) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) solution (representing two possible classes of HTLs where carriers transport via valence and conduction bands, respectively) offer continuous WF tuning (the tuning range as large as 0.81 eV) by controlling F5BnPA's concentration. By employing a deep HOMO donor material, OSCs using the composite HTLs can achieve improved performances with largely increased VOC (0.92 V for GO:F5BnPA versus 0.65 V for pristine GO; 0.91 V for MoOx:F5BnPA versus 0.88 V for pristine MoOx). The enhanced performance can be experimentally and theoretically explained by the decreased hole injection barrier (HIB) for GO or equivalent HIB (i.e. electron extraction barrier) for MoOx and enhanced surface recombination velocity, which contribute to eliminating S-shaped current{\textendash}voltage characteristics. Consequently, the incorporation of F5BnPA can efficiently tune HTL WF for high VOC OSCs and extend HTL applications in organic electronics.},
